Processing Steps:
- When only year or year and month provided for publication date or original publication date, we set month and day to 1. When an invalid date is provided, we try to make it valid as much as possible. For example, if the provided date is 2019-28, we set the date to 2019-01-01.
- Exclude records where the author is "NOT A BOOK" (usually journals, notebooks, planners, calendars, etc. See Goodreads description of this author). Examples: 50145364, 42190702, 45797073, 52120457, 31745544.
- Around 300,000 records have the author as "Anonymous" and ~200,000 "Unknown". We keep these records. (See Goodreads descriptions).
- Remove extra white spaces from author names.
- There are 2786577 records where ISBN or ISBN13 are not null but aren't valid ISBNs (not 10/13 digits). We keep these records.
- Replace "en-US", "en-GB", etc. with "eng" for language. There are other languages with similar issues, but much less frequent.
- `rating_dist` column gets splitted into 5 columns, one for each rating.
- HTML tags are removed from description. [Not implemented]

Notes About Works:
- Work ID is the same for all editions of a book. But it's different for related books. For example, work ID for "Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul: Inspirational Stories About Sisters and Their Changing Relationships" is different than the work ID for "Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul 2: Celebrating Love and Laughter Throughout Our Lives".
- Books with the same work ID have (almost) the same rating and review data, original publication date, series ID and name, and shelves. But they have different title, publication date, description, number of pages, etc.

Stats for Excluding Records:
- All books: 47,015,693
- Books with rating count > 0: 23,356,640
- Books with rating count >= 10: 12,506,971
- Works: 27,442,602
- Works with rating count > 0: 9,320,928


- Created the `goodreads_books_p` table which implements the processing steps above and which includes books with rating count > 0.
- Created the `goodreads_works_p` table which implements the processing steps above and which includes works with rating count > 0. The book selection for a given work ID is done by selecting the book with minimum ID that has a publication date (not null) and has a cover image. If there is no book with these criteria for a given work ID, then the book with minimum ID is selected. -->
