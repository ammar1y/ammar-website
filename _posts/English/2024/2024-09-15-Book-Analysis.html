<h1 class="title">Exploring Goodreads Data: An Analysis of 10 Million Books</h1>

<!--  animate__animated animate__bounce -->
<!-- <div id="feat-img"></div> -->

<!-- <p class="par">In this post, I’ll present the results of analyzing the data of 10+ million books on Goodreads.</p> -->

<p class="par">Goodreads is one of the largest book websites on the internet. It has data about millions and millions of books from different genres and in many languages. It’s hard not to find a book on Goodreads whether it's published hundreds of years ago or just a few days ago.</p>

<p class="par">Today, I present the analysis results of more than 10 million books on Goodreads. In fact, the original dataset that I used had 50+ million books but I excluded 40 million of them for data quality reasons mentioned later in this article.</p>

<div class="feat-img">
    <img src="/assets/book-analysis-1/feat-img.png" alt="feat-img"> 
</div>

<p class="par">Goodreads allows you to search for any book and view its info, but there is no way to see all the available books and interact with them. Using the data in this analysis, however, I was able to do just that with millions of titles. Below, I’ll share some interesting findings and provide a method for further exploration at the end.</p>

<p class="par">Continue reading to know more about the analysis and the data or you can <a href="#ref2">jump directly to the results section</a>. But don't also forget to read about <a href="#ref1">how to get the most out of this analysis</a>.</p>

<h1 class="top-heading">Data Used</h1>
<p class="par">I used an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/opalskies/large-books-metadata-dataset-50-mill-entries">obscure dataset</a> published on Kaggle a few years ago. Its size uncompressed is 90 GB which made it hard to deal with on my personal computer, so I used cloud services (on AWS) for that. More on that below.</p>

<p class="par">The dataset contains information about 50+ million books published throughout the years up to 2021. It contains information about books including title, author, publisher, publication date, average rating, number of ratings, number of reviews, number of pages, categories assigned by users, format, and more.</p>

<h1 class="top-heading">Method and Tools</h1>

<p class="par">As mentioned above, the dataset is large (90 GB) and it’s hard to deal with on a personal computer. So I used cloud services to process the data and extract the information I needed for the analysis. I used AWS services for that. I uploaded the data to S3 then used Glue to discover the data on S3 and define a structured table on top of it. From there, I used Athena to query the data, explore it, and extract the subset I needed for the analysis.</p>

<p class="par">The original dataset contains 50+ million books but most of them are not useful for the analysis. For example, some "books" are actually journals, notebooks, planners, calendars, etc. so I excluded them. I also excluded books with no ratings at all, meaning no one had rated them on Goodreads. After that, I ended up with around 23 million books.</p>

<p class="par">Some of these 23 million books were actually the same book but in different editions. For example, a book can have an English edition, a French edition, a Spanish edition, etc. It also can have multiple editions in the same language. I wanted to analyze books, not editions, so I selected one edition for each book. I ended up with around 9 million unique books.</p>

<p class="par">I Used SQL in Athena to clean the data and make it more structured and ready for analysis. Then I downloaded the data to my computer and started the analysis. To perform the analysis, I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, OpenCV, and other libraries for data processing and analysis inside a Jupyter Notebook.</p> 

<p class="par">For the interactive data visualization that you will see below, I used D3.js and in a few cases Observable Plot. This is my first time I extensively use D3.js for data visualization and I found it very powerful and flexible. It's now one of my favorite libraries although it has a steep learning curve. I've used Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other libraries for data vis before but D3.js is different and more powerful in many ways.</p>

<h1 class="top-heading">How to Use this Analysis</h1>
<p class="par">Here are some quick important notes to help you get the most of this analysis.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Filtering: Fiction, Non-Fiction, or All</h2>
<p class="par" id="show-fg-trg">The analysis covers millions of books. You can filter the analysis results to see only fiction books, only non-fiction books, or all books (the default option.) You can do that by clicking on the filter buttons (<span class="material-symbols-outlined inline-icon">tune</span>) on the right side of the screen. When you select an option, all charts and numbers on the page change to reflect the selected option.</p>

<p class="par note">You can also use keyboard shortcuts: <span class="keybk">Shift</span> + <span class="keybk">F</span> for fiction, <span class="keybk">Shift</span> + <span class="keybk">N</span> for non-fiction, and <span class="keybk">Shift</span> + <span class="keybk">A</span> for all.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">Interactive Charts</h2>
<p class="par">This analysis is interactive, meaning you can hover over the charts to see more info about the data points. For example, you can hover over a book to see its title, author, and other info.</p>

<!-- <h1 class="top-heading analysis-results">Analysis Results</h1> -->
<p class="par analysis-results-p">Now let’s begin with the analysis results...</p>

<div id="ref2"></div>

<h1 class="top-heading">Top Books</h1>

<p class="par">Let’s start with the top books on Goodreads. We will look at the most rated books, most reviewed books, and top rated books.</p>

<p class="par">Each book on Goodreads can be rated by users between 1 and 5 stars. The average rating of a book is a good indicator of its quality. The number of ratings a book receives is also a good indicator of its popularity.</p>

<div class="module">
<h2 class="section-heading">Most Popular Books</h2>

<p class="par">The following chart shows books that received the largest number of ratings, indicating that they are the most popular on the platform. <span class="int-ins">Hover over any bar to see more info about the book. Click on a book cover to go to its page on Goodreads.</span></p>

<div id="most-rated-books-chart" class="chart-con"></div>

<p class="par">The histogram below shows the distribution of book rating counts. Note that the y-axis is log scaled (i.e. it goes like 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc. instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) <span class="int-ins">Hover over any bar to see the number of books with that rating count.</span></p>

<div id="ratings-hist-chart" class="chart-con"></div>

</div>






<div class="module">
<h2 class="section-heading">Most Reviewed Books</h2>

<p class="par">In addition to rating a book between 1 and 5 stars, users can leave a written review where they talk about their opinion about the books, their notes, recommendations, etc.</p>

<p class="par">In addition to indicating popularity like the number of ratings above, the number of reviews points out the impact of the book. In other words, it’s easy to rate a book but to write a review, it usually means you have more to say about the book, whether positive or negative.</p>

<p class="par">The following chart shows books that received the highest number of reviews. <span class="int-ins">Hover over any bar to see more info about the book. Click on a book cover to go to its page on Goodreads.</span></p>

<!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Highest Rated Books</h2>

<div id="highest-rated-books-chart" class="chart-con"></div> -->



<div class="module">
<h2 class="section-heading featured">Top Rated Books</h2>

<p class="par">When searching for the top-rated books on Goodreads, it's important to consider not only the average rating but also the number of ratings each book has received. While there are some books with a perfect 5/5 rating, they often have a low number of ratings, which can make the rating less reliable.</p>

<p class="par">To find the most highly-rated books on Goodreads, I used two methods that you can choose between:</p>

<h4>Weighted Rating</h4>

<p class="par">The weighted rating takes into account both the average rating (out of 5) and the number of ratings a book has received. Average rating is a crucial metric, but relying solely on it can be misleading for books with very few ratings. So we add number of ratings to the formula to enhance the reliability. A high number of ratings can indicate a more trustworthy average rating.</p>

<p class="par">The weighted rating formula combines these two metrics as follows:</p>

<div class="math-eq">
\[ \begin{align}
\text{Weighted Rating}_i = \frac{n_i \times r_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{m} n_j}
\end{align} \]
</div>

<p class="par">Where:
- \(i\) is the index of the current book
- \(n_i\) is the number of ratings for book \(i\)
- \(r_i\) is the average rating for book \(i\)
- \(m\) is the total number of books
- \(\sum_{j=1}^{m} n_j\) is the sum of the number of ratings for all books</p>


<p class="par">This formula ensures that books with a higher number of ratings and a high average rating will rank higher than those with fewer ratings, even if they have a perfect 5/5 average rating.</p>

<h4>Percentage of 5-Star Ratings</h4>

<p class="par">Another approach to finding top-rated books is to look at the percentage of 5-star (or 5/5) ratings the book has received. For instance, if a book has a 5-star percentage of 40%, it means that 40% of the ratings given to the book are the highest possible rating of 5/5. The remaining 60% of the ratings are split among lower ratings.</p>

<p class="par">By focusing on books with a high percentage of 5-star ratings, we can identify those that have not only received high ratings but have also maintained that high level of satisfaction among a significant number of reviewers.</p>

<p class="par note">Note: For the two methods mentioned above, we excluded books with less than 500 ratings.</p>

<p class="par">Use the filter below to switch between methods. <span class="int-ins">Hover over any book cover in the chart to see more info. Click on a book cover (if you're not on a mobile device) to go to its page on Goodreads.</span></p>

<p class="par">The following chart shows the median number of pages for books published each decade between 1700s and 2020s. This is a good indicator of the typical length of books over time. We use the median, not the average, because there are a few books with an extremely high number of pages that would skew the average, so the median is more robust in this case.</p>

<p class="par note">Books that don't have an actual number of pages (like books in audio formats) are excluded from this analysis.</p>

<h1 class="top-heading">Book Covers</h1>

<div class="module">
<h2 class="section-heading">Popular Colors in Book Covers</h2>
<p class="par">The following chart shows the most popular colors in book covers. You can see that we show colors for three groups of books:</p>

<ul class="par-ul">
    <li>Most rated 1,000 books</li>
    <li>Top rated 1,000 books</li>
    <li>Random sample of 1,000 books that are not in the above two groups</li>
</ul>

<p class="par">The size of each color reflects its popularity, meaning colors with wider areas were used more frequently in book covers.</p>

<p class="par">To get the most popular colors in each of the three groups mentioned above, I downloaded the images of the 1,000 book covers in the group, extracted the colors of all pixels in the images, converted the colors to the CIELAB color space which is designed to approximate human vision, then ran a clustering algorithm on all the colors to group them in 15 clusters. After that, I fetched the colors at the centers of the clusters and the number of pixels that belong to each cluster and the results are what you're looking at below.</p>

<p class="par note">Books with no cover image or with 50 ratings or less were excluded from this analysis.</p>

Processing Steps:
- When only year or year and month provided for publication date or original publication date, we set month and day to 1. When an invalid date is provided, we try to make it valid as much as possible. For example, if the provided date is 2019-28, we set the date to 2019-01-01.
- Exclude records where the author is "NOT A BOOK" (usually journals, notebooks, planners, calendars, etc. See Goodreads description of this author). Examples: 50145364, 42190702, 45797073, 52120457, 31745544.
- Around 300,000 records have the author as "Anonymous" and ~200,000 "Unknown". We keep these records. (See Goodreads descriptions).
- Remove extra white spaces from author names.
- There are 2786577 records where ISBN or ISBN13 are not null but aren't valid ISBNs (not 10/13 digits). We keep these records.
- Replace "en-US", "en-GB", etc. with "eng" for language. There are other languages with similar issues, but much less frequent.
- `rating_dist` column gets splitted into 5 columns, one for each rating.
- HTML tags are removed from description. [Not implemented]

Notes About Works:
- Work ID is the same for all editions of a book. But it's different for related books. For example, work ID for "Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul: Inspirational Stories About Sisters and Their Changing Relationships" is different than the work ID for "Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul 2: Celebrating Love and Laughter Throughout Our Lives".
- Books with the same work ID have (almost) the same rating and review data, original publication date, series ID and name, and shelves. But they have different title, publication date, description, number of pages, etc.

Stats for Excluding Records:
- All books: 47,015,693
