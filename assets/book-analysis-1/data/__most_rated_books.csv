His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.<br /><br />Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.","309","2003-11-01","1997-06-26",,,"Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154022l/3._SX98_.jpg","Scholastic Inc","45175","Harry Potter","eng","[{name=fantasy, count=63540}, {name=favorites, count=57260}, {name=to-read, count=20889}, {name=fiction, count=18715}, {name=young-adult, count=18694}, {name=harry-potter, count=11877}, {name=books-i-own, count=10142}, {name=ya, count=7024}, {name=series, count=6225}, {name=favourites, count=6218}, {name=magic, count=5169}, {name=childrens, count=4848}, {name=re-read, count=4047}, {name=middle-grade, count=3475}, {name=adventure, count=3113}, {name=children, count=3082}, {name=classics, count=2861}, {name=owned-books, count=2817}, {name=audiobook, count=2739}, {name=audiobooks, count=2564}, {name=reread, count=2396}, {name=childhood, count=2328}, {name=children-s, count=2226}, {name=currently-reading, count=2058}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=1944}, {name=my-books, count=1806}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=1805}, {name=j-k-rowling, count=1771}, {name=5-stars, count=1685}, {name=kids, count=1632}, {name=children-s-books, count=1570}, {name=novels, count=1526}, {name=favorite-books, count=1378}, {name=my-library, count=1352}, {name=default, count=1335}, {name=favorite, count=1254}, {name=audio, count=1189}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=1163}, {name=english, count=1147}, {name=re-reads, count=1143}, {name=i-own, count=1128}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=1121}, {name=books, count=1067}, {name=library, count=1047}, {name=paranormal, count=994}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=989}, {name=read-in-2016, count=964}, {name=read-in-2017, count=918}, {name=read-in-2020, count=915}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=912}, {name=witches, count=906}, {name=read-in-2018, count=870}, {name=mystery, count=837}, {name=childrens-books, count=837}, {name=novel, count=830}, {name=kindle, count=829}, {name=british, count=826}, {name=read-in-2019, count=818}, {name=faves, count=793}, {name=rereads, count=787}, {name=favorite-series, count=752}, {name=teen, count=751}, {name=bookshelf, count=746}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=745}, {name=my-favorites, count=727}, {name=audible, count=719}, {name=read-in-2015, count=718}, {name=ya-fiction, count=714}, {name=audio-books, count=705}, {name=jk-rowling, count=702}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=685}, {name=supernatural, count=676}, {name=kids-books, count=674}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=673}, {name=read-in-english, count=664}, {name=ebook, count=660}, {name=classic, count=651}, {name=harry-potter-series, count=651}, {name=own-it, count=632}, {name=favs, count=629}, {name=re-reading, count=614}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=608}, {name=fantasia, count=607}, {name=juvenile, count=592}, {name=read-2020, count=590}, {name=children-s-literature, count=589}, {name=all-time-favourites, count=581}, {name=2020-reads, count=578}, {name=favourite, count=576}, {name=childhood-books, count=575}, {name=youth, count=571}, {name=read-in-2014, count=567}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=565}, {name=hp, count=561}, {name=5-star, count=546}, {name=wizards, count=533}, {name=favoritos, count=527}, {name=young-adult-fantasy, count=509}, {name=children-s-lit, count=509}, {name=friendship, count=508}]","1"

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","374","2008-09-14","2008-09-14","0439023483","9780439023481","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722975l/2767052._SX98_.jpg","Scholastic Press","73758","The Hunger Games","eng","[{name=to-read, count=1016898}, {name=currently-reading, count=59312}, {name=favorites, count=53579}, {name=young-adult, count=30814}, {name=fiction, count=17301}, {name=dystopian, count=16057}, {name=fantasy, count=13537}, {name=ya, count=13434}, {name=dystopia, count=12942}, {name=science-fiction, count=10575}, {name=books-i-own, count=8499}, {name=to-read, count=8375}, {name=sci-fi, count=7727}, {name=owned, count=7144}, {name=series, count=5961}, {name=favourites, count=4883}, {name=romance, count=3917}, {name=adventure, count=3415}, {name=hunger-games, count=3184}, {name=owned-books, count=2231}, {name=kindle, count=2117}, {name=book-club, count=2102}, {name=teen, count=1879}, {name=my-books, count=1751}, {name=post-apocalyptic, count=1638}, {name=the-hunger-games, count=1579}, {name=re-read, count=1565}, {name=favorite-books, count=1565}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=1453}, {name=5-stars, count=1448}, {name=read-in-2012, count=1425}, {name=audiobook, count=1371}, {name=action, count=1358}, {name=ya-fiction, count=1329}, {name=books, count=1271}, {name=suzanne-collins, count=1267}, {name=scifi, count=1236}, {name=audiobooks, count=1232}, {name=favorite, count=1228}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=1217}, {name=survival, count=1144}, {name=novels, count=1127}, {name=ebook, count=1061}, {name=i-own, count=986}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=959}, {name=reread, count=952}, {name=thriller, count=948}, {name=library, count=905}, {name=read-in-2011, count=878}, {name=my-library, count=871}, {name=default, count=849}, {name=my-favorites, count=849}, {name=faves, count=800}, {name=ebooks, count=787}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=778}, {name=futuristic, count=717}, {name=read-2012, count=706}, {name=audio, count=702}, {name=suspense, count=659}, {name=favs, count=644}, {name=distopia, count=629}, {name=ya-books, count=622}, {name=read-in-2010, count=583}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=580}, {name=finished, count=578}, {name=favorite-series, count=567}, {name=ya-lit, count=563}, {name=action-adventure, count=561}, {name=bookshelf, count=558}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=551}, {name=teen-fiction, count=550}, {name=own-it, count=545}, {name=english, count=544}, {name=dystopian-fiction, count=528}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=527}, {name=love-triangle, count=522}, {name=love, count=521}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=519}, {name=novel, count=516}, {name=coming-of-age, count=513}, {name=distopian, count=512}, {name=ya-dystopian, count=502}, {name=4-stars, count=499}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=477}, {name=loved, count=475}, {name=re-reads, count=471}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=467}, {name=5-star, count=464}, {name=borrowed, count=463}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=449}, {name=favourite, count=448}, {name=contemporary, count=439}, {name=read-in-2013, count=433}, {name=read-in-2020, count=433}, {name=have, count=428}, {name=kindle-unlimited, count=424}, {name=favourite-books, count=423}, {name=to-buy, count=421}, {name=books-i-have, count=413}, {name=drama, count=413}]","1"

It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.<br /><br />Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.<br />Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.<br /><br />During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</p>","487","2011-04-25","2011-04-25","0062024027","9780062024022","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327873996l/8306857._SX98_.jpg","Katherine Tegen Books","57530","Divergent","eng","[{name=to-read, count=829888}, {name=currently-reading, count=38345}, {name=favorites, count=27619}, {name=young-adult, count=20723}, {name=dystopian, count=13892}, {name=dystopia, count=10275}, {name=ya, count=10162}, {name=fiction, count=7051}, {name=fantasy, count=6553}, {name=books-i-own, count=5941}, {name=science-fiction, count=5869}, {name=sci-fi, count=4433}, {name=owned, count=4389}, {name=series, count=4164}, {name=romance, count=4050}, {name=favourites, count=2449}, {name=divergent, count=2157}, {name=owned-books, count=1575}, {name=kindle, count=1511}, {name=adventure, count=1499}, {name=read-in-2014, count=1406}, {name=teen, count=1271}, {name=my-books, count=1166}, {name=book-club, count=1123}, {name=read-in-2013, count=1027}, {name=ya-fiction, count=929}, {name=favorite-books, count=908}, {name=audiobook, count=884}, {name=post-apocalyptic, count=871}, {name=action, count=865}, {name=ebook, count=834}, {name=read-in-2012, count=823}, {name=veronica-roth, count=816}, {name=5-stars, count=812}, {name=library, count=789}, {name=audiobooks, count=729}, {name=re-read, count=716}, {name=i-own, count=697}, {name=read-2014, count=691}, {name=favorite, count=669}, {name=ebooks, count=651}, {name=books, count=649}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=649}, {name=scifi, count=646}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=613}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=609}, {name=divergent-series, count=555}, {name=my-library, count=506}, {name=audio, count=501}, {name=ya-books, count=495}, {name=ya-dystopian, count=490}, {name=default, count=465}, {name=dystopian-fiction, count=465}, {name=read-in-2011, count=441}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=441}, {name=2014-reads, count=434}, {name=read-2013, count=432}, {name=distopia, count=432}, {name=novels, count=426}, {name=futuristic, count=426}, {name=faves, count=420}, {name=to-buy, count=418}, {name=my-favorites, count=415}, {name=distopian, count=411}, {name=coming-of-age, count=406}, {name=reread, count=400}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=397}, {name=ya-lit, count=395}, {name=4-stars, count=394}, {name=bookshelf, count=386}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=385}, {name=read-in-2015, count=379}, {name=teen-fiction, count=376}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=366}, {name=finished, count=360}, {name=reviewed, count=356}, {name=dnf, count=352}, {name=love, count=349}, {name=favs, count=347}, {name=english, count=342}, {name=dystopias, count=332}, {name=read-2012, count=330}, {name=e-book, count=322}, {name=books-i-have, count=321}, {name=own-it, count=313}, {name=trilogy, count=311}, {name=e-books, count=302}, {name=2013-reads, count=297}, {name=read-in-english, count=296}, {name=ya-dystopia, count=294}, {name=thriller, count=290}, {name=action-adventure, count=289}, {name=audible, count=288}, {name=have, count=278}, {name=loved, count=271}, {name=favorite-series, count=270}, {name=borrowed, count=270}, {name=audio-books, count=268}, {name=completed-series, count=267}, {name=abandoned, count=267}]","1"

With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned—a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. <br /> <br />When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.","122","2003-05-06","1945-08-17","0452284244","9780452284241","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424037542l/7613._SX98_.jpg","NAL",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=857632}, {name=classics, count=33372}, {name=currently-reading, count=28382}, {name=fiction, count=19244}, {name=favorites, count=12772}, {name=classic, count=5555}, {name=dystopia, count=3849}, {name=owned, count=3610}, {name=to-read, count=3472}, {name=fantasy, count=3156}, {name=dystopian, count=2915}, {name=literature, count=2765}, {name=politics, count=2610}, {name=books-i-own, count=2587}, {name=school, count=2401}, {name=science-fiction, count=1989}, {name=novels, count=1734}, {name=favourites, count=1639}, {name=satire, count=1366}, {name=sci-fi, count=1235}, {name=read-for-school, count=1030}, {name=english, count=989}, {name=novel, count=974}, {name=philosophy, count=929}, {name=political, count=918}, {name=owned-books, count=911}, {name=animals, count=851}, {name=high-school, count=809}, {name=school-books, count=769}, {name=audiobook, count=763}, {name=library, count=743}, {name=adult, count=731}, {name=classic-literature, count=700}, {name=audiobooks, count=685}, {name=for-school, count=680}, {name=to-buy, count=667}, {name=british, count=666}, {name=young-adult, count=655}, {name=1001-books, count=613}, {name=20th-century, count=610}, {name=re-read, count=609}, {name=modern-classics, count=609}, {name=my-library, count=549}, {name=george-orwell, count=530}, {name=literary-fiction, count=506}, {name=historical-fiction, count=500}, {name=kindle, count=497}, {name=default, count=497}, {name=books, count=484}, {name=adult-fiction, count=484}, {name=my-books, count=480}, {name=british-literature, count=446}, {name=classics-to-read, count=427}, {name=english-literature, count=405}, {name=classic-fiction, count=401}, {name=روايات, count=395}, {name=1001, count=390}, {name=ebook, count=384}, {name=allegory, count=379}, {name=general-fiction, count=377}, {name=history, count=364}, {name=school-reads, count=357}, {name=to-re-read, count=348}, {name=5-stars, count=334}, {name=classic-lit, count=331}, {name=banned-books, count=330}, {name=audio, count=327}, {name=read-in-english, count=319}, {name=read-in-school, count=319}, {name=book-club, count=318}, {name=favorite, count=312}, {name=literary, count=311}, {name=novella, count=307}, {name=favorite-books, count=300}, {name=must-read, count=289}, {name=classici, count=289}, {name=historical, count=287}, {name=read-in-2020, count=285}, {name=reread, count=280}, {name=school-reading, count=280}, {name=i-own, count=276}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=271}, {name=bookshelf, count=260}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=257}, {name=read-in-2019, count=244}, {name=clásicos, count=244}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=244}, {name=to-reread, count=243}, {name=ebooks, count=241}, {name=borrowed, count=237}, {name=read-in-2015, count=235}, {name=orwell, count=233}, {name=tbr, count=232}, {name=required-reading, count=232}, {name=read-in-2018, count=231}, {name=read-in-2016, count=231}, {name=4-stars, count=231}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=230}, {name=drama, count=229}, {name=read-in-2017, count=229}]","1"

In August 1944 they were betrayed, Anne died in the ghastly concentration camp at Belsen.

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br /><br />And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone, or something, starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects: Harry Potter himself?","352","2003-11-01","1998-07-02","0439554896","9780439554893","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154604l/4._SX98_.jpg","Scholastic","45175","Harry Potter","eng","[{name=to-read, count=282341}, {name=currently-reading, count=67110}, {name=fantasy, count=53030}, {name=favorites, count=34786}, {name=young-adult, count=15740}, {name=fiction, count=15485}, {name=harry-potter, count=10479}, {name=books-i-own, count=8918}, {name=owned, count=8559}, {name=ya, count=5687}, {name=series, count=5265}, {name=magic, count=4372}, {name=favourites, count=4032}, {name=childrens, count=3770}, {name=re-read, count=3119}, {name=middle-grade, count=2659}, {name=owned-books, count=2514}, {name=children, count=2467}, {name=adventure, count=2361}, {name=audiobook, count=2329}, {name=audiobooks, count=2160}, {name=childhood, count=1881}, {name=reread, count=1794}, {name=children-s, count=1747}, {name=classics, count=1636}, {name=j-k-rowling, count=1604}, {name=my-books, count=1548}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=1345}, {name=default, count=1255}, {name=5-stars, count=1245}, {name=children-s-books, count=1212}, {name=kids, count=1206}, {name=novels, count=1198}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=1182}, {name=my-library, count=1164}, {name=audio, count=1006}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=991}, {name=i-own, count=990}, {name=english, count=931}, {name=re-reads, count=928}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=926}, {name=favorite-books, count=895}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=868}, {name=library, count=856}, {name=favorite, count=841}, {name=books, count=806}, {name=mystery, count=799}, {name=paranormal, count=787}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=778}, {name=read-in-2017, count=769}, {name=witches, count=754}, {name=read-in-2016, count=745}, {name=read-in-2018, count=735}, {name=read-in-2020, count=726}, {name=jk-rowling, count=704}, {name=british, count=688}, {name=childrens-books, count=682}, {name=read-in-2019, count=669}, {name=novel, count=665}, {name=rereads, count=651}, {name=kindle, count=647}, {name=bookshelf, count=646}, {name=teen, count=621}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=613}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=606}, {name=harry-potter-series, count=579}, {name=ya-fiction, count=577}, {name=audio-books, count=565}, {name=read-in-2015, count=564}, {name=audible, count=564}, {name=supernatural, count=549}, {name=own-it, count=545}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=528}, {name=ebook, count=517}, {name=read-in-english, count=514}, {name=juvenile, count=512}, {name=fantasia, count=508}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=494}, {name=read-2020, count=492}, {name=2020-reads, count=490}, {name=my-favorites, count=485}, {name=youth, count=485}, {name=wizards, count=476}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=475}, {name=kids-books, count=474}, {name=childhood-books, count=471}, {name=faves, count=469}, {name=read-in-2014, count=466}, {name=favorite-series, count=451}, {name=hp, count=427}, {name=children-s-literature, count=415}, {name=5-star, count=408}, {name=read-2017, count=407}, {name=read-2019, count=405}, {name=read-2018, count=404}, {name=audio-book, count=399}, {name=england, count=398}, {name=classic, count=397}, {name=children-s-lit, count=396}, {name=re-reading, count=395}]","1"

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on <i>Time</i>'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","277","2001-01-30","1951-07-16","0316769177","9780316769174","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398034300l/5107._SX98_.jpg","Back Bay Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=931862}, {name=to-read, count=32493}, {name=classics, count=31999}, {name=currently-reading, count=26210}, {name=favorites, count=19570}, {name=fiction, count=18098}, {name=classic, count=5046}, {name=young-adult, count=4144}, {name=owned, count=3755}, {name=books-i-own, count=3349}, {name=literature, count=2590}, {name=school, count=2103}, {name=favourites, count=1856}, {name=novels, count=1709}, {name=coming-of-age, count=1507}, {name=ya, count=1480}, {name=high-school, count=1063}, {name=american, count=1050}, {name=owned-books, count=1024}, {name=american-literature, count=988}, {name=novel, count=912}, {name=re-read, count=829}, {name=read-for-school, count=829}, {name=library, count=699}, {name=to-buy, count=686}, {name=book-club, count=686}, {name=classic-literature, count=680}, {name=literary-fiction, count=662}, {name=school-books, count=645}, {name=classics-to-read, count=636}, {name=english, count=636}, {name=clàssics, count=628}, {name=1001-books, count=604}, {name=modern-classics, count=599}, {name=for-school, count=599}, {name=my-library, count=591}, {name=20th-century, count=583}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=551}, {name=my-books, count=539}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=521}, {name=to-re-read, count=515}, {name=favorite-books, count=498}, {name=contemporary, count=494}, {name=general-fiction, count=476}, {name=banned-books, count=455}, {name=default, count=438}, {name=american-lit, count=432}, {name=adult, count=414}, {name=classic-fiction, count=395}, {name=1001, count=389}, {name=usa, count=389}, {name=adult-fiction, count=386}, {name=reread, count=380}, {name=books, count=378}, {name=drama, count=378}, {name=i-own, count=371}, {name=favorite, count=362}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=352}, {name=dnf, count=348}, {name=to-reread, count=345}, {name=classic-lit, count=330}, {name=read-in-english, count=321}, {name=bookshelf, count=309}, {name=literary, count=303}, {name=school-reads, count=303}, {name=bildungsroman, count=300}, {name=abandoned, count=295}, {name=must-read, count=281}, {name=read-in-school, count=280}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=279}, {name=new-york, count=278}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=276}, {name=great-american-read, count=269}, {name=historical-fiction, count=268}, {name=read-again, count=266}, {name=the-classics, count=258}, {name=ebook, count=255}, {name=tbr, count=254}, {name=american-classics, count=253}, {name=teen, count=249}, {name=faves, count=246}, {name=to-read-classics, count=243}, {name=5-stars, count=239}, {name=home-library, count=238}, {name=did-not-finish, count=234}, {name=lit, count=232}, {name=favs, count=228}, {name=own-it, count=226}, {name=required-reading, count=223}, {name=to-read-again, count=222}, {name=kindle, count=222}, {name=1950s, count=222}, {name=school-reading, count=221}, {name=wish-list, count=220}, {name=my-favorites, count=214}, {name=america, count=210}, {name=classici, count=206}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=206}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=202}, {name=have, count=201}]","1"

Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, and deserted cathedrals, and into the depths of the most secretive vault on earth...the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.<br />(back cover)","736","2006-04-01","2000-05-01","1416524797","9781416524793","Mass Market Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558711679l/960._SY160_.jpg","Pocket Books","92467","Robert Langdon","eng","[{name=to-read, count=594291}, {name=currently-reading, count=14941}, {name=fiction, count=12026}, {name=mystery, count=6993}, {name=thriller, count=6093}, {name=favorites, count=5751}, {name=dan-brown, count=2541}, {name=owned, count=2525}, {name=books-i-own, count=2093}, {name=suspense, count=1511}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=1447}, {name=series, count=1291}, {name=adventure, count=1127}, {name=crime, count=1084}, {name=historical-fiction, count=992}, {name=default, count=946}, {name=novels, count=850}, {name=adult, count=764}, {name=thrillers, count=748}, {name=owned-books, count=717}, {name=contemporary, count=666}, {name=adult-fiction, count=559}, {name=religion, count=534}, {name=my-books, count=516}, {name=novel, count=465}, {name=favourites, count=456}, {name=my-library, count=422}, {name=mystery-suspense, count=419}, {name=fantasy, count=415}, {name=general-fiction, count=405}, {name=library, count=403}, {name=action, count=349}, {name=robert-langdon, count=329}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=305}, {name=mysteries, count=303}, {name=historical, count=294}, {name=drama, count=291}, {name=ebook, count=290}, {name=i-own, count=285}, {name=thriller-mystery, count=277}, {name=action-adventure, count=277}, {name=audiobook, count=271}, {name=books, count=270}, {name=crime-thriller, count=262}, {name=crime-mystery, count=259}, {name=english, count=256}, {name=suspense-thriller, count=252}, {name=audiobooks, count=244}, {name=conspiracy, count=234}, {name=history, count=230}, {name=kindle, count=216}, {name=brown-dan, count=214}, {name=to-buy, count=210}, {name=thriller-suspense, count=195}, {name=literature, count=192}, {name=italy, count=191}, {name=science-fiction, count=188}, {name=mystery-crime, count=188}, {name=american, count=183}, {name=borrowed, count=181}, {name=bookshelf, count=175}, {name=favorite, count=172}, {name=finished, count=165}, {name=5-stars, count=163}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=161}, {name=home-library, count=159}, {name=sci-fi, count=154}, {name=own-it, count=154}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=152}, {name=other, count=149}, {name=have, count=146}, {name=audio, count=146}, {name=detective, count=145}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=143}, {name=ebooks, count=139}, {name=classics, count=139}, {name=dnf, count=138}, {name=tbr, count=136}, {name=book-club, count=136}, {name=paperback, count=135}, {name=re-read, count=131}, {name=modern-fiction, count=130}, {name=brown, count=126}, {name=favorite-books, count=124}, {name=2005, count=119}, {name=faves, count=118}, {name=روايات, count=118}, {name=american-literature, count=117}, {name=romance, count=114}, {name=personal-library, count=113}, {name=religious, count=112}, {name=books-i-have, count=112}, {name=read-fiction, count=110}, {name=movies, count=109}, {name=must-read, count=108}, {name=mystery-thrillers, count=108}, {name=abandoned, count=106}, {name=mistery, count=105}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=105}, {name=murder-mystery, count=104}]","1"

He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years.

She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.<br /><br />Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.

Not Katniss's family, not her friends, not the people of District 12.","390","2010-08-24","2010-08-01","0439023513","9780439023511","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722918l/7260188._SX98_.jpg","Scholastic Press","73758","The Hunger Games","eng","[{name=to-read, count=287296}, {name=currently-reading, count=31368}, {name=young-adult, count=24659}, {name=favorites, count=22856}, {name=dystopian, count=13336}, {name=fiction, count=12556}, {name=dystopia, count=10628}, {name=ya, count=10611}, {name=fantasy, count=9812}, {name=science-fiction, count=7795}, {name=books-i-own, count=7065}, {name=owned, count=5791}, {name=sci-fi, count=5727}, {name=series, count=4996}, {name=romance, count=2920}, {name=adventure, count=2378}, {name=hunger-games, count=2278}, {name=favourites, count=2083}, {name=owned-books, count=1947}, {name=kindle, count=1888}, {name=teen, count=1448}, {name=my-books, count=1368}, {name=post-apocalyptic, count=1224}, {name=read-in-2012, count=1204}, {name=suzanne-collins, count=1156}, {name=the-hunger-games, count=1132}, {name=audiobook, count=1070}, {name=ya-fiction, count=1065}, {name=re-read, count=996}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=951}, {name=action, count=944}, {name=audiobooks, count=940}, {name=ebook, count=914}, {name=scifi, count=899}, {name=books, count=794}, {name=i-own, count=793}, {name=read-in-2011, count=793}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=774}, {name=novels, count=752}, {name=my-library, count=737}, {name=favorite-books, count=735}, {name=default, count=727}, {name=ebooks, count=708}, {name=survival, count=695}, {name=library, count=684}, {name=read-in-2010, count=679}, {name=war, count=663}, {name=thriller, count=635}, {name=5-stars, count=620}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=612}, {name=favorite, count=597}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=582}, {name=reread, count=579}, {name=read-2012, count=578}, {name=made-me-cry, count=573}, {name=audio, count=562}, {name=futuristic, count=559}, {name=book-club, count=516}, {name=read-in-2014, count=511}, {name=distopia, count=502}, {name=ya-books, count=476}, {name=hunger-games-series, count=463}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=458}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=443}, {name=bookshelf, count=441}, {name=teen-fiction, count=439}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=428}, {name=english, count=422}, {name=dystopian-fiction, count=418}, {name=love-triangle, count=417}, {name=own-it, count=417}, {name=ya-lit, count=415}, {name=read-in-2013, count=408}, {name=borrowed, count=406}, {name=my-favorites, count=405}, {name=ya-dystopian, count=404}, {name=distopian, count=402}, {name=suspense, count=400}, {name=action-adventure, count=397}, {name=4-stars, count=388}, {name=novel, count=374}, {name=finished, count=374}, {name=faves, count=373}, {name=read-2011, count=370}, {name=to-buy, count=357}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=357}, {name=trilogy, count=351}, {name=e-book, count=339}, {name=favorite-series, count=338}, {name=dystopias, count=333}, {name=books-i-have, count=327}, {name=audio-books, count=325}, {name=have, count=323}, {name=coming-of-age, count=323}, {name=finished-series, count=321}, {name=read-in-english, count=320}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=320}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=320}, {name=re-reads, count=319}, {name=favs, count=312}]","1"

The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.<br /><br />On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?<br /><br />As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?<br /><br />With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.<br />Source: gillian-flynn.com","399","2012-05-24","2012-04-22","0297859382","9780297859383","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339602131l/8442457._SX98_.jpg","Weidenfeld & Nicolson",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=905548}, {name=currently-reading, count=39265}, {name=fiction, count=12099}, {name=favorites, count=12015}, {name=mystery, count=10158}, {name=thriller, count=7133}, {name=book-club, count=4724}, {name=books-i-own, count=2900}, {name=owned, count=2782}, {name=crime, count=2752}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=2296}, {name=suspense, count=2250}, {name=contemporary, count=2024}, {name=adult, count=1763}, {name=kindle, count=1598}, {name=adult-fiction, count=1338}, {name=audiobook, count=1284}, {name=favourites, count=1086}, {name=audiobooks, count=1076}, {name=thrillers, count=1008}, {name=read-in-2014, count=938}, {name=library, count=842}, {name=ebook, count=833}, {name=novels, count=823}, {name=owned-books, count=802}, {name=read-in-2013, count=764}, {name=bookclub, count=728}, {name=psychological-thriller, count=686}, {name=audio, count=674}, {name=dnf, count=640}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=637}, {name=mystery-suspense, count=595}, {name=read-in-2015, count=593}, {name=drama, count=592}, {name=mysteries, count=584}, {name=read-in-2012, count=542}, {name=my-books, count=539}, {name=to-buy, count=502}, {name=read-2014, count=498}, {name=gillian-flynn, count=494}, {name=5-stars, count=490}, {name=thriller-mystery, count=477}, {name=crime-thriller, count=463}, {name=ebooks, count=457}, {name=book-club-books, count=449}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=446}, {name=dark, count=443}, {name=read-2013, count=423}, {name=thriller-suspense, count=409}, {name=audio-books, count=391}, {name=faves, count=387}, {name=audible, count=385}, {name=abandoned, count=383}, {name=did-not-finish, count=382}, {name=my-library, count=373}, {name=recommended, count=347}, {name=suspense-thriller, count=343}, {name=tbr, count=340}, {name=romance, count=337}, {name=general-fiction, count=331}, {name=crime-mystery, count=330}, {name=default, count=319}, {name=read-2015, count=318}, {name=psychological, count=309}, {name=novel, count=307}, {name=favorite-books, count=307}, {name=audio-book, count=300}, {name=favorite, count=295}, {name=mystery-crime, count=292}, {name=must-read, count=284}, {name=book-club-reads, count=279}, {name=i-own, count=275}, {name=crime-fiction, count=273}, {name=american, count=267}, {name=2014-reads, count=262}, {name=my-favorites, count=262}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=254}, {name=great-american-read, count=252}, {name=e-book, count=252}, {name=read-2012, count=250}, {name=page-turner, count=248}, {name=english, count=248}, {name=e-books, count=246}, {name=stand-alone, count=244}, {name=borrowed, count=243}, {name=finished, count=243}, {name=horror, count=242}, {name=recommend, count=241}, {name=read-in-2016, count=238}, {name=reviewed, count=229}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=229}, {name=bookshelf, count=228}, {name=five-stars, count=227}, {name=4-stars, count=221}, {name=unreliable-narrator, count=210}, {name=wish-list, count=209}, {name=2013-reads, count=205}, {name=2013-books, count=199}, {name=gone-girl, count=194}, {name=2015-reading-challenge, count=191}]","1"

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.<br /><br />Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.<br /><br />Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.<br /><br />Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.<br /><br />In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. <br />(jacket flap)","451","2009-02-10","2009-02-10",,,"Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572940430l/4667024._SX98_.jpg","Amy Einhorn Books/G.P.

The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.<br /><br />Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.<br /><br />source: georgerrmartin.com","835","2005-08-01","1996-08-06","0553588486","9780553588484","Mass Market Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496._SY160_.jpg","Bantam","43790","A Song of Ice and Fire","eng","[{name=to-read, count=764057}, {name=currently-reading, count=100445}, {name=fantasy, count=45127}, {name=favorites, count=18397}, {name=fiction, count=10281}, {name=owned, count=5040}, {name=books-i-own, count=4019}, {name=series, count=2936}, {name=favourites, count=1876}, {name=epic-fantasy, count=1861}, {name=kindle, count=1522}, {name=adult, count=1519}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=1480}, {name=high-fantasy, count=1409}, {name=owned-books, count=1258}, {name=adventure, count=1232}, {name=audiobook, count=1092}, {name=a-song-of-ice-and-fire, count=1057}, {name=dragons, count=996}, {name=game-of-thrones, count=990}, {name=audiobooks, count=975}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=901}, {name=default, count=817}, {name=epic, count=809}, {name=dnf, count=802}, {name=novels, count=745}, {name=abandoned, count=725}, {name=my-books, count=717}, {name=george-r-r-martin, count=701}, {name=ebook, count=692}, {name=library, count=652}, {name=my-library, count=633}, {name=on-hold, count=600}, {name=adult-fiction, count=589}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=579}, {name=did-not-finish, count=563}, {name=science-fiction, count=544}, {name=audio, count=540}, {name=re-read, count=531}, {name=audible, count=497}, {name=books, count=488}, {name=magic, count=485}, {name=sci-fi, count=475}, {name=english, count=461}, {name=ebooks, count=461}, {name=5-stars, count=458}, {name=tbr, count=449}, {name=war, count=441}, {name=read-in-2012, count=440}, {name=i-own, count=438}, {name=read-in-2014, count=398}, {name=fantasia, count=397}, {name=to-buy, count=395}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=393}, {name=science-fiction-fantasy, count=387}, {name=historical-fiction, count=373}, {name=fantasy-scifi, count=365}, {name=novel, count=362}, {name=unfinished, count=360}, {name=favorite-books, count=353}, {name=read-in-2013, count=351}, {name=favorite, count=336}, {name=medieval, count=327}, {name=audio-books, count=319}, {name=read-in-2011, count=317}, {name=classics, count=308}, {name=bookshelf, count=306}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=301}, {name=fantasy-fiction, count=293}, {name=historical, count=288}, {name=romance, count=287}, {name=adult-fantasy, count=285}, {name=asoiaf, count=285}, {name=fantasía, count=284}, {name=read-in-2015, count=282}, {name=e-book, count=279}, {name=read-in-english, count=276}, {name=fiction-fantasy, count=272}, {name=reread, count=266}, {name=got, count=264}, {name=own-it, count=263}, {name=song-of-ice-and-fire, count=261}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=259}, {name=action, count=255}, {name=sci-fi-and-fantasy, count=250}, {name=american, count=246}, {name=have, count=243}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=239}, {name=audio-book, count=235}, {name=book-club, count=234}, {name=drama, count=230}, {name=e-books, count=227}, {name=george-rr-martin, count=226}, {name=paperback, count=218}, {name=read-in-2019, count=215}, {name=owned-tbr, count=212}, {name=faves, count=212}, {name=genre-fantasy, count=211}, {name=read-in-2016, count=210}, {name=read-2012, count=207}]","1"

And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friends—one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.","375","2006-03-01","2005-06-28","0786838655","9780786838653","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400602609l/28187._SX98_.jpg","Disney Hyperion Books","40736","Percy Jackson and the Olympians","eng","[{name=to-read, count=572397}, {name=currently-reading, count=30530}, {name=to-read, count=29169}, {name=fantasy, count=22645}, {name=favorites, count=18675}, {name=young-adult, count=9878}, {name=mythology, count=5674}, {name=fiction, count=4540}, {name=books-i-own, count=4307}, {name=ya, count=4205}, {name=owned, count=3774}, {name=middle-grade, count=3314}, {name=series, count=3077}, {name=percy-jackson, count=2522}, {name=adventure, count=2468}, {name=rick-riordan, count=2320}, {name=favourites, count=1683}, {name=childrens, count=1583}, {name=owned-books, count=1141}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=1105}, {name=children, count=1066}, {name=greek-mythology, count=1010}, {name=kids, count=827}, {name=children-s, count=820}, {name=audiobook, count=782}, {name=re-read, count=760}, {name=magic, count=756}, {name=my-books, count=755}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=690}, {name=audiobooks, count=680}, {name=5-stars, count=611}, {name=kindle, count=599}, {name=childhood, count=597}, {name=library, count=596}, {name=favorite-books, count=595}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=594}, {name=reread, count=542}, {name=teen, count=529}, {name=children-s-books, count=518}, {name=books, count=511}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=505}, {name=i-own, count=487}, {name=ebook, count=465}, {name=favorite, count=439}, {name=action, count=436}, {name=paranormal, count=433}, {name=to-buy, count=424}, {name=middle-school, count=416}, {name=kindle-unlimited, count=405}, {name=ya-fiction, count=401}, {name=default, count=389}, {name=my-library, count=389}, {name=percy-jackson-and-the-olympians, count=385}, {name=4-stars, count=384}, {name=audio, count=378}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=373}, {name=kids-books, count=371}, {name=read-in-2020, count=369}, {name=favorite-series, count=350}, {name=supernatural, count=340}, {name=novels, count=339}, {name=juvenile, count=327}, {name=action-adventure, count=326}, {name=ebooks, count=304}, {name=tbr, count=303}, {name=read-in-2014, count=301}, {name=read-in-2010, count=301}, {name=faves, count=298}, {name=childrens-books, count=292}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=289}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=289}, {name=favs, count=287}, {name=read-in-2016, count=286}, {name=read-in-2015, count=284}, {name=contemporary, count=281}, {name=my-favorites, count=279}, {name=bookshelf, count=277}, {name=read-in-2013, count=273}, {name=humor, count=265}, {name=juvenile-fiction, count=261}, {name=gods, count=255}, {name=own-it, count=254}, {name=2020-reads, count=253}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=253}, {name=read-in-2017, count=250}, {name=borrowed, count=245}, {name=youth, count=245}, {name=mystery, count=241}, {name=read-in-2018, count=240}, {name=english, count=234}, {name=funny, count=232}, {name=have, count=228}, {name=books-i-have, count=226}, {name=children-s-lit, count=225}, {name=read-in-2019, count=222}, {name=friendship, count=220}, {name=finished-series, count=217}, {name=completed-series, count=215}, {name=school, count=215}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=211}]","1"

Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.<br /><br />By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.<br /><br />But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.<br /><br />In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.<br /><br />(Note: this title was not published as YA fiction)","552","2006-03-14","2005-09-01","0375831002","9780375831003","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522157426l/19063._SX98_.jpg","Alfred A.

Summoning up more than twenty years of Japan's most dramatic history, it uncovers a hidden world of eroticism and enchantment, exploitation and degradation. From a small fishing village in 1929, the tale moves to the glamorous and decadent heart of Kyoto in the 1930s, where a young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. She tells her story many years later from the Waldorf Astoria in New York; it exquisitely evokes another culture, a different time and the details of an extraordinary way of life. It conjures up the perfection and the ugliness of life behind rice-paper screens, where young girls learn the arts of geisha - dancing and singing, how to wind the kimono, how to walk and pour tea, and how to beguile the most powerful men.","497","2005-12-01","1997-09-23","0099498189","9780099498186","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473774066l/931._SX98_.jpg","Vintage",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=646930}, {name=fiction, count=10306}, {name=currently-reading, count=10304}, {name=favorites, count=9943}, {name=historical-fiction, count=9349}, {name=romance, count=2239}, {name=historical, count=2180}, {name=books-i-own, count=1913}, {name=owned, count=1894}, {name=classics, count=1849}, {name=japan, count=1631}, {name=favourites, count=971}, {name=book-club, count=842}, {name=adult, count=801}, {name=novels, count=665}, {name=asia, count=630}, {name=adult-fiction, count=604}, {name=owned-books, count=601}, {name=history, count=593}, {name=contemporary, count=591}, {name=literature, count=481}, {name=general-fiction, count=464}, {name=drama, count=444}, {name=1001-books, count=426}, {name=novel, count=415}, {name=library, count=373}, {name=memoir, count=371}, {name=to-buy, count=341}, {name=default, count=336}, {name=my-books, count=329}, {name=my-library, count=324}, {name=classic, count=324}, {name=literary-fiction, count=319}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=317}, {name=asian, count=316}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=307}, {name=audiobook, count=279}, {name=cultural, count=276}, {name=biography, count=258}, {name=non-fiction, count=257}, {name=favorite-books, count=251}, {name=chick-lit, count=246}, {name=1001, count=241}, {name=memoirs, count=233}, {name=audiobooks, count=225}, {name=great-american-read, count=221}, {name=japanese, count=219}, {name=kindle, count=213}, {name=i-own, count=212}, {name=favorite, count=207}, {name=bookclub, count=201}, {name=20th-century, count=186}, {name=women, count=185}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=184}, {name=tbr, count=176}, {name=own-it, count=176}, {name=my-favorites, count=173}, {name=historical-romance, count=164}, {name=books, count=160}, {name=geisha, count=159}, {name=faves, count=158}, {name=5-stars, count=157}, {name=american, count=156}, {name=dnf, count=152}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=152}, {name=re-read, count=150}, {name=english, count=143}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=141}, {name=bookshelf, count=141}, {name=fiction-historical, count=141}, {name=coming-of-age, count=137}, {name=finished, count=136}, {name=audio, count=134}, {name=movies, count=133}, {name=wish-list, count=133}, {name=modern-fiction, count=130}, {name=movie, count=129}, {name=home-library, count=126}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=123}, {name=other, count=123}, {name=borrowed, count=123}, {name=historic-fiction, count=122}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=120}, {name=ebook, count=118}, {name=culture, count=118}, {name=stand-alone, count=117}, {name=have, count=111}, {name=must-read, count=110}, {name=did-not-finish, count=108}, {name=war, count=106}, {name=maybe, count=103}, {name=literary, count=103}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=103}, {name=modern-classics, count=103}, {name=4-stars, count=102}, {name=favs, count=102}, {name=wwii, count=102}, {name=abandoned, count=101}, {name=american-literature, count=100}, {name=recommended, count=99}]","1"

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.<br /><p>It is no secret that Alcott based <i>Little Women</i> on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. <i>Little Women</i> brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>","449","2004-04-06","1868-09-30","0451529308","9780451529305","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475l/1934._SX98_.jpg","Signet Classics","191497","Little Women","eng","[{name=to-read, count=742578}, {name=currently-reading, count=71583}, {name=classics, count=29981}, {name=favorites, count=11127}, {name=fiction, count=8849}, {name=classic, count=4964}, {name=historical-fiction, count=3266}, {name=books-i-own, count=3133}, {name=young-adult, count=2803}, {name=owned, count=2771}, {name=romance, count=1713}, {name=favourites, count=1236}, {name=historical, count=1229}, {name=literature, count=1047}, {name=childrens, count=1004}, {name=kindle, count=972}, {name=book-club, count=882}, {name=ya, count=880}, {name=childhood, count=879}, {name=owned-books, count=773}, {name=children, count=770}, {name=classic-literature, count=693}, {name=audiobook, count=641}, {name=novels, count=622}, {name=19th-century, count=613}, {name=audiobooks, count=589}, {name=tbr, count=582}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=536}, {name=dnf, count=531}, {name=coming-of-age, count=529}, {name=classics-to-read, count=511}, {name=my-books, count=509}, {name=children-s, count=505}, {name=1001-books, count=493}, {name=re-read, count=491}, {name=my-library, count=490}, {name=series, count=483}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=479}, {name=to-buy, count=478}, {name=read-in-2020, count=456}, {name=library, count=452}, {name=american, count=442}, {name=children-s-books, count=428}, {name=american-literature, count=417}, {name=family, count=401}, {name=my-ebooks, count=399}, {name=ebook, count=371}, {name=novel, count=345}, {name=audio, count=335}, {name=did-not-finish, count=333}, {name=women, count=327}, {name=i-own, count=318}, {name=ebooks, count=315}, {name=physical-tbr, count=311}, {name=abandoned, count=303}, {name=favorite-books, count=299}, {name=classic-lit, count=298}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=297}, {name=feminism, count=291}, {name=drama, count=288}, {name=english, count=279}, {name=1001, count=274}, {name=classic-fiction, count=274}, {name=2020-reads, count=273}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=270}, {name=default, count=268}, {name=chick-lit, count=266}, {name=great-american-read, count=262}, {name=reread, count=262}, {name=clásicos, count=257}, {name=owned-tbr, count=256}, {name=adult, count=252}, {name=literary-fiction, count=251}, {name=kids, count=246}, {name=read-2020, count=246}, {name=louisa-may-alcott, count=239}, {name=american-lit, count=234}, {name=bookshelf, count=223}, {name=to-re-read, count=222}, {name=own-it, count=222}, {name=adult-fiction, count=221}, {name=clàssics, count=220}, {name=favorite, count=219}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=219}, {name=5-stars, count=218}, {name=the-classics, count=213}, {name=nook, count=211}, {name=history, count=211}, {name=general-fiction, count=210}, {name=childrens-books, count=208}, {name=school, count=208}, {name=audible, count=208}, {name=my-favorites, count=204}, {name=female-authors, count=203}, {name=classics-tbr, count=203}, {name=to-read-classics, count=202}, {name=middle-grade, count=202}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=201}, {name=read-in-2019, count=201}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=201}]","1"

Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?<br /><br />This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight?

She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. <br /><br />To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. <br /><br />An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.","368","2007-02-01","2006-02-16","0143038419","9780143038412","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414l/19501._SX98_.jpg","Riverhead Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=599960}, {name=currently-reading, count=24685}, {name=non-fiction, count=5752}, {name=favorites, count=4185}, {name=memoir, count=3683}, {name=travel, count=2441}, {name=nonfiction, count=2307}, {name=fiction, count=1543}, {name=book-club, count=1453}, {name=books-i-own, count=1440}, {name=memoirs, count=1365}, {name=biography, count=1221}, {name=owned, count=1037}, {name=chick-lit, count=893}, {name=romance, count=740}, {name=spirituality, count=690}, {name=contemporary, count=498}, {name=biography-memoir, count=491}, {name=autobiography, count=473}, {name=abandoned, count=468}, {name=adult, count=418}, {name=did-not-finish, count=392}, {name=owned-books, count=382}, {name=self-help, count=373}, {name=audiobook, count=371}, {name=dnf, count=364}, {name=bookclub, count=362}, {name=audiobooks, count=361}, {name=spiritual, count=361}, {name=india, count=353}, {name=inspirational, count=342}, {name=italy, count=336}, {name=novels, count=295}, {name=library, count=289}, {name=memoir-biography, count=281}, {name=my-library, count=274}, {name=favourites, count=272}, {name=my-books, count=264}, {name=biographies, count=263}, {name=food, count=262}, {name=default, count=228}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=222}, {name=to-buy, count=215}, {name=religion, count=214}, {name=audio, count=213}, {name=couldn-t-finish, count=208}, {name=unfinished, count=192}, {name=kindle, count=184}, {name=women, count=182}, {name=gave-up-on, count=181}, {name=i-own, count=175}, {name=book-club-books, count=168}, {name=english, count=159}, {name=adventure, count=159}, {name=indonesia, count=159}, {name=read-in-2010, count=151}, {name=elizabeth-gilbert, count=148}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=145}, {name=favorite-books, count=135}, {name=philosophy, count=134}, {name=own-it, count=133}, {name=adult-fiction, count=132}, {name=finished, count=126}, {name=drama, count=123}, {name=love, count=121}, {name=favorite, count=121}, {name=could-not-finish, count=120}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=119}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=118}, {name=movies, count=116}, {name=ebook, count=113}, {name=novel, count=112}, {name=audio-books, count=112}, {name=bookshelf, count=110}, {name=american, count=106}, {name=autobiography-memoir, count=105}, {name=book-group, count=105}, {name=tbr, count=101}, {name=memoirs-biographies, count=101}, {name=travel-writing, count=100}, {name=bio-memoir, count=100}, {name=home-library, count=98}, {name=audio-book, count=98}, {name=ebooks, count=97}, {name=never-finished, count=97}, {name=borrowed, count=97}, {name=humor, count=95}, {name=movie, count=94}, {name=yoga, count=94}, {name=book-club-reads, count=93}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=92}, {name=chicklit, count=91}, {name=re-read, count=90}, {name=gave-up, count=89}, {name=books, count=86}, {name=stopped-reading, count=86}, {name=wish-list, count=85}, {name=have, count=84}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=82}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=81}]","1"

A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her. <br /><br />Beautifully written, Water for Elephants is illuminated by a wonderful sense of time and place.

A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.<br /><br /><i>Did You Know?---<br /> <br />The Notebook was only the third novel in recent history to spend over a year as a hardcover best-seller?<br />One of the poems by Walt Whitman quoted in the novel is entitled ""To a Common Prostitute?""<br />The title for the novel was chosen by Theresa Park, Nicholas's agent?</i>","254","1999-12-01","1996-10-01","0446676098","9780446676090","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434857904l/3472._SX98_.jpg","Grand Central Publishing","93822","The Notebook",,"[{name=to-read, count=444466}, {name=currently-reading, count=8488}, {name=romance, count=7339}, {name=fiction, count=3948}, {name=favorites, count=3735}, {name=nicholas-sparks, count=2124}, {name=books-i-own, count=1545}, {name=chick-lit, count=1493}, {name=owned, count=1030}, {name=contemporary, count=942}, {name=adult, count=604}, {name=adult-fiction, count=441}, {name=owned-books, count=389}, {name=my-books, count=359}, {name=contemporary-romance, count=329}, {name=love, count=296}, {name=classics, count=269}, {name=drama, count=268}, {name=novels, count=264}, {name=default, count=244}, {name=favourites, count=233}, {name=library, count=228}, {name=to-buy, count=219}, {name=series, count=217}, {name=young-adult, count=212}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=210}, {name=historical-fiction, count=206}, {name=great-american-read, count=204}, {name=my-library, count=194}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=193}, {name=love-stories, count=185}, {name=love-story, count=181}, {name=romantic, count=177}, {name=movies, count=174}, {name=sparks, count=171}, {name=i-own, count=167}, {name=novel, count=164}, {name=tear-jerker, count=162}, {name=kindle, count=152}, {name=movie, count=148}, {name=general-fiction, count=144}, {name=books, count=139}, {name=made-me-cry, count=137}, {name=favorite-books, count=133}, {name=book-club, count=127}, {name=chic-lit, count=127}, {name=the-notebook, count=124}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=118}, {name=favorite, count=118}, {name=ebook, count=114}, {name=book-to-movie, count=113}, {name=audiobook, count=112}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=111}, {name=finished, count=110}, {name=ebooks, count=110}, {name=5-stars, count=109}, {name=english, count=108}, {name=borrowed, count=104}, {name=books-to-movies, count=98}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=97}, {name=have, count=96}, {name=my-favorites, count=96}, {name=chicklit, count=96}, {name=saw-the-movie, count=90}, {name=own-it, count=89}, {name=books-i-have, count=85}, {name=tbr, count=85}, {name=historical, count=85}, {name=bookshelf, count=83}, {name=audiobooks, count=83}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=81}, {name=wish-list, count=81}, {name=high-school, count=79}, {name=sparks-nicholas, count=78}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=77}, {name=adult-romance, count=76}, {name=dnf, count=76}, {name=want-to-read, count=72}, {name=re-read, count=71}, {name=4-stars, count=70}, {name=audio, count=69}, {name=tear-jerkers, count=69}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=66}, {name=guilty-pleasures, count=65}, {name=classic, count=64}, {name=pbs-great-american-read, count=62}, {name=literature, count=59}, {name=paperback, count=59}, {name=books-made-into-movies, count=59}, {name=mine, count=58}, {name=need-to-buy, count=58}, {name=3-stars, count=58}, {name=already-read, count=57}, {name=stand-alone, count=57}, {name=ya, count=56}, {name=womens-fiction, count=55}, {name=faves, count=55}, {name=must-read, count=55}, {name=home-library, count=54}, {name=abandoned, count=54}]","1"

He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.<br /><br />Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.","226","2004-05-18","2003-07-31","1400032717","9781400032716","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479863624l/1618._SX98_.jpg","Vintage",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=433590}, {name=fiction, count=12719}, {name=currently-reading, count=12509}, {name=favorites, count=6191}, {name=mystery, count=3443}, {name=young-adult, count=3049}, {name=contemporary, count=2218}, {name=books-i-own, count=2060}, {name=owned, count=2020}, {name=book-club, count=1945}, {name=ya, count=1237}, {name=favourites, count=940}, {name=autism, count=876}, {name=novels, count=859}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=849}, {name=classics, count=840}, {name=psychology, count=670}, {name=literature, count=631}, {name=general-fiction, count=611}, {name=owned-books, count=603}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=594}, {name=school, count=541}, {name=adult-fiction, count=539}, {name=1001-books, count=505}, {name=library, count=504}, {name=adult, count=483}, {name=audiobook, count=469}, {name=novel, count=452}, {name=english, count=451}, {name=literary-fiction, count=436}, {name=bookclub, count=423}, {name=audiobooks, count=420}, {name=british, count=393}, {name=to-buy, count=313}, {name=audio, count=313}, {name=my-library, count=307}, {name=1001, count=299}, {name=my-books, count=293}, {name=mental-health, count=288}, {name=default, count=281}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=280}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=271}, {name=coming-of-age, count=268}, {name=great-american-read, count=258}, {name=drama, count=257}, {name=crime, count=249}, {name=england, count=241}, {name=read-for-school, count=232}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=227}, {name=humor, count=227}, {name=i-own, count=226}, {name=kindle, count=220}, {name=re-read, count=210}, {name=read-in-english, count=208}, {name=modern-fiction, count=199}, {name=book-club-books, count=199}, {name=ebook, count=196}, {name=family, count=191}, {name=borrowed, count=190}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=174}, {name=read-in-2014, count=173}, {name=mental-illness, count=172}, {name=for-school, count=170}, {name=audible, count=170}, {name=mysteries, count=168}, {name=dnf, count=168}, {name=literary, count=166}, {name=disability, count=166}, {name=read-in-2015, count=165}, {name=21st-century, count=165}, {name=book-group, count=163}, {name=school-books, count=163}, {name=bookshelf, count=163}, {name=recommended, count=161}, {name=high-school, count=160}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=154}, {name=own-it, count=154}, {name=books, count=152}, {name=abandoned, count=151}, {name=read-in-2016, count=151}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=148}, {name=favorite-books, count=146}, {name=uk, count=143}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=141}, {name=children, count=140}, {name=british-literature, count=139}, {name=teen, count=139}, {name=ebooks, count=139}, {name=adventure, count=136}, {name=home-library, count=136}, {name=favorite, count=135}, {name=wish-list, count=134}, {name=finished, count=134}, {name=childrens, count=133}, {name=audio-books, count=131}, {name=tbr, count=128}, {name=rory-gilmore, count=125}, {name=did-not-finish, count=124}, {name=ya-fiction, count=123}, {name=2000s, count=123}]","1"

The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.","400","2000-01-24","1884-12-01","039598078X","9780395980781","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390014224l/2955._SX98_.jpg","Houghton Mifflin Company","295971","Adventures of Tom and Huck",,"[{name=to-read, count=333595}, {name=currently-reading, count=27314}, {name=classics, count=22094}, {name=fiction, count=9699}, {name=classic, count=3855}, {name=favorites, count=2991}, {name=historical-fiction, count=1996}, {name=owned, count=1852}, {name=literature, count=1662}, {name=young-adult, count=1649}, {name=books-i-own, count=1598}, {name=adventure, count=1550}, {name=school, count=1437}, {name=novels, count=793}, {name=read-for-school, count=702}, {name=american-literature, count=676}, {name=american, count=660}, {name=high-school, count=650}, {name=classic-literature, count=643}, {name=childrens, count=624}, {name=historical, count=616}, {name=children, count=582}, {name=19th-century, count=517}, {name=school-books, count=495}, {name=for-school, count=491}, {name=owned-books, count=476}, {name=childhood, count=472}, {name=ya, count=466}, {name=novel, count=437}, {name=1001-books, count=417}, {name=kindle, count=390}, {name=humor, count=383}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=377}, {name=american-lit, count=357}, {name=library, count=351}, {name=my-library, count=339}, {name=children-s, count=337}, {name=my-ebooks, count=325}, {name=coming-of-age, count=324}, {name=default, count=323}, {name=classic-fiction, count=316}, {name=classics-to-read, count=315}, {name=audiobook, count=314}, {name=literary-fiction, count=308}, {name=my-books, count=300}, {name=mark-twain, count=297}, {name=audiobooks, count=284}, {name=to-buy, count=282}, {name=children-s-books, count=282}, {name=banned-books, count=282}, {name=classic-lit, count=268}, {name=re-read, count=252}, {name=1001, count=250}, {name=general-fiction, count=250}, {name=kids, count=230}, {name=read-in-school, count=228}, {name=school-reads, count=218}, {name=english, count=214}, {name=usa, count=206}, {name=adult, count=202}, {name=i-own, count=199}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=195}, {name=history, count=193}, {name=school-reading, count=191}, {name=american-classics, count=187}, {name=audible, count=187}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=185}, {name=required-reading, count=180}, {name=book-club, count=176}, {name=ebook, count=175}, {name=books, count=174}, {name=the-classics, count=173}, {name=audio, count=172}, {name=favourites, count=168}, {name=literary, count=166}, {name=adult-fiction, count=166}, {name=to-re-read, count=164}, {name=rory-gilmore, count=160}, {name=satire, count=158}, {name=gilmore-girls, count=158}, {name=ebooks, count=158}, {name=home-library, count=157}, {name=tbr, count=154}, {name=america, count=154}, {name=slavery, count=153}, {name=southern, count=152}, {name=dnf, count=144}, {name=childrens-books, count=143}, {name=own-it, count=142}, {name=to-read-classics, count=141}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=139}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=139}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-list, count=130}, {name=read-in-high-school, count=127}, {name=abandoned, count=124}, {name=bookshelf, count=123}, {name=fiction-classics, count=119}, {name=middle-grade, count=117}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=115}, {name=childhood-books, count=112}]","1"

By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.<br /><br />A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, <i>My Sister's Keeper</i> is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.","423","2005-02-01","2004-04-06","0743454537","9780743454537","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369504683l/10917._SX98_.jpg","Washington Square Press",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=259039}, {name=currently-reading, count=6778}, {name=fiction, count=5960}, {name=favorites, count=4550}, {name=books-i-own, count=1572}, {name=contemporary, count=1518}, {name=jodi-picoult, count=1095}, {name=owned, count=1071}, {name=book-club, count=996}, {name=chick-lit, count=908}, {name=young-adult, count=701}, {name=drama, count=655}, {name=adult, count=628}, {name=adult-fiction, count=602}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=517}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=482}, {name=favourites, count=396}, {name=owned-books, count=349}, {name=family, count=345}, {name=general-fiction, count=342}, {name=novels, count=310}, {name=ya, count=274}, {name=my-books, count=269}, {name=made-me-cry, count=240}, {name=library, count=231}, {name=bookclub, count=230}, {name=tear-jerker, count=202}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=196}, {name=i-own, count=186}, {name=default, count=179}, {name=kindle, count=174}, {name=my-library, count=166}, {name=cancer, count=165}, {name=favorite-books, count=165}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=165}, {name=novel, count=156}, {name=to-buy, count=154}, {name=audiobook, count=149}, {name=sisters, count=141}, {name=audiobooks, count=134}, {name=book-club-books, count=131}, {name=5-stars, count=129}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=127}, {name=favorite, count=126}, {name=picoult, count=123}, {name=my-favorites, count=120}, {name=sad, count=117}, {name=death, count=113}, {name=borrowed, count=108}, {name=literary-fiction, count=106}, {name=medical, count=104}, {name=ebook, count=102}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=101}, {name=stand-alone, count=100}, {name=bookshelf, count=100}, {name=movies, count=97}, {name=romance, count=96}, {name=read-in-2009, count=96}, {name=own-it, count=96}, {name=audio, count=93}, {name=faves, count=93}, {name=have, count=92}, {name=tear-jerkers, count=91}, {name=dnf, count=90}, {name=movie, count=90}, {name=finished, count=90}, {name=ebooks, count=89}, {name=books-i-have, count=89}, {name=family-relationships, count=88}, {name=realistic, count=88}, {name=coming-of-age, count=87}, {name=book-to-movie, count=86}, {name=books, count=85}, {name=classics, count=85}, {name=rory-gilmore, count=84}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=83}, {name=high-school, count=83}, {name=illness, count=83}, {name=book-group, count=82}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=81}, {name=literature, count=81}, {name=tbr, count=80}, {name=wish-list, count=79}, {name=2005, count=77}, {name=recommended, count=76}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=75}, {name=womens-fiction, count=75}, {name=relationships, count=74}, {name=books-that-made-me-cry, count=74}, {name=women-s-fiction, count=70}, {name=modern-fiction, count=70}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-list, count=69}, {name=must-read, count=69}, {name=chicklit, count=68}, {name=american, count=68}, {name=female-authors, count=67}, {name=gilmore-girls, count=66}, {name=home-library, count=66}, {name=books-to-movies, count=65}, {name=audio-books, count=65}]","1"

People are also saying that their father has run off and left their brilliant scientist mother. Spurred on by these rumors, Meg and Charles Wallace, along with their new friend Calvin, embark on a perilous quest through space to find their father. In doing so they must travel behind the shadow of an evil power that is darkening the cosmos, one planet at a time.</p><p><br />Young people who have trouble finding their place in the world will connect with the ""misfit"" characters in this provocative story. This is no superhero tale, nor is it science fiction, although it shares elements of both. The travelers must rely on their individual and collective strengths, delving deep into their characters to find answers.</p><p><br />A classic since 1962, Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> is sophisticated in concept yet warm in tone, with mystery and love coursing through its pages. Meg's shattering yet ultimately freeing discovery that her father is not omnipotent provides a satisfying coming-of-age element. Readers will feel a sense of power as they travel with these three children, challenging concepts of time, space, and the power of good over evil. <i> (Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><p>

He claims to have been blown off course, and goes on to tell them that there is such a thing as a ""tesseract,"" which, if you didn't know, is a wrinkle in time.</p><p><br /><br />Meg's father had been experimenting with time-travel when he suddenly disappeared.

The tale of Dorian Gray’s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it ﬁrst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel’s corrupting inﬂuence, he responded that there is, in fact, “a terrible moral in <i>Dorian Gray</i>.” Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde’s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Gray’s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.","272","2004-06-01","1890-07-20",,,"Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546103428l/5297._SX98_.jpg","Random House: Modern Library",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=667681}, {name=currently-reading, count=57147}, {name=classics, count=27433}, {name=favorites, count=14077}, {name=fiction, count=10007}, {name=classic, count=4164}, {name=owned, count=3380}, {name=horror, count=3124}, {name=books-i-own, count=2884}, {name=fantasy, count=2284}, {name=favourites, count=2130}, {name=literature, count=1715}, {name=gothic, count=1575}, {name=novels, count=995}, {name=clàssics, count=994}, {name=kindle, count=974}, {name=owned-books, count=937}, {name=19th-century, count=876}, {name=book-club, count=704}, {name=lgbt, count=659}, {name=classic-literature, count=643}, {name=english, count=617}, {name=adult, count=564}, {name=1001-books, count=548}, {name=to-buy, count=547}, {name=classics-to-read, count=538}, {name=novel, count=537}, {name=audiobook, count=537}, {name=school, count=527}, {name=historical-fiction, count=523}, {name=audiobooks, count=511}, {name=tbr, count=509}, {name=my-library, count=500}, {name=british, count=495}, {name=lgbtq, count=490}, {name=library, count=466}, {name=my-ebooks, count=466}, {name=victorian, count=456}, {name=my-books, count=440}, {name=classici, count=435}, {name=default, count=431}, {name=british-literature, count=414}, {name=ebook, count=409}, {name=dnf, count=393}, {name=irish, count=388}, {name=ebooks, count=369}, {name=dark-academia, count=365}, {name=literary-fiction, count=365}, {name=historical, count=360}, {name=english-literature, count=355}, {name=re-read, count=334}, {name=oscar-wilde, count=333}, {name=1001, count=333}, {name=clásicos, count=329}, {name=adult-fiction, count=316}, {name=philosophy, count=309}, {name=bookshelf, count=293}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=291}, {name=abandoned, count=291}, {name=read-in-english, count=288}, {name=fictión, count=287}, {name=books, count=287}, {name=classic-lit, count=286}, {name=favorite-books, count=282}, {name=audio, count=282}, {name=queer, count=281}, {name=i-own, count=274}, {name=mystery, count=259}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=257}, {name=favorite, count=257}, {name=classic-fiction, count=252}, {name=ireland, count=251}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=249}, {name=paranormal, count=244}, {name=england, count=239}, {name=drama, count=235}, {name=favoritos, count=234}, {name=to-read-classics, count=233}, {name=read-for-school, count=232}, {name=physical-tbr, count=226}, {name=great-american-read, count=224}, {name=to-re-read, count=223}, {name=5-stars, count=222}, {name=faves, count=221}, {name=read-in-2020, count=219}, {name=on-hold, count=218}, {name=klassiker, count=218}, {name=magical-realism, count=217}, {name=audible, count=214}, {name=did-not-finish, count=213}, {name=supernatural, count=211}, {name=favs, count=210}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=203}, {name=classics-tbr, count=202}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=195}, {name=owned-tbr, count=194}, {name=own-it, count=192}, {name=4-stars, count=187}, {name=general-fiction, count=185}, {name=for-school, count=184}]","1"

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.<br /><br />But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world–until the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.<br /><br />The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.","384","2018-08-14","2018-08-14","0735219117","9780735219113","ebook","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582135294l/36809135._SX98_.jpg","G.P.

An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs. It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow-impossible though it seems-they may still be alive. A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.","352","2011-06-07","2011-06-07",,,,"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327928017l/10428902._SX98_.jpg","Quirk Books","76161","Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children","eng","[{name=to-read, count=678164}, {name=currently-reading, count=27097}, {name=fantasy, count=12941}, {name=young-adult, count=9499}, {name=favorites, count=5998}, {name=fiction, count=4793}, {name=ya, count=4689}, {name=to-read, count=4016}, {name=books-i-own, count=3866}, {name=owned, count=3098}, {name=paranormal, count=2554}, {name=mystery, count=1917}, {name=series, count=1861}, {name=horror, count=1424}, {name=book-club, count=1338}, {name=time-travel, count=1177}, {name=historical-fiction, count=1144}, {name=owned-books, count=1071}, {name=supernatural, count=945}, {name=library, count=748}, {name=kindle, count=748}, {name=adventure, count=730}, {name=read-in-2016, count=711}, {name=dnf, count=673}, {name=my-books, count=628}, {name=audiobook, count=578}, {name=teen, count=574}, {name=favourites, count=560}, {name=audiobooks, count=553}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=496}, {name=ebook, count=487}, {name=to-buy, count=482}, {name=historical, count=474}, {name=tbr, count=434}, {name=ya-fiction, count=420}, {name=my-library, count=406}, {name=science-fiction, count=404}, {name=read-in-2015, count=401}, {name=read-2016, count=396}, {name=i-own, count=396}, {name=did-not-finish, count=395}, {name=read-in-2014, count=394}, {name=magic, count=387}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=375}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=373}, {name=sci-fi, count=371}, {name=abandoned, count=346}, {name=default, count=344}, {name=romance, count=343}, {name=audio, count=341}, {name=read-in-2017, count=320}, {name=ebooks, count=318}, {name=read-in-2012, count=316}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=305}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=298}, {name=2016-reads, count=280}, {name=magical-realism, count=280}, {name=bookshelf, count=272}, {name=childrens, count=268}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=268}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=259}, {name=children, count=254}, {name=wish-list, count=248}, {name=novels, count=244}, {name=thriller, count=234}, {name=middle-grade, count=231}, {name=read-in-2013, count=231}, {name=read-2014, count=230}, {name=ransom-riggs, count=230}, {name=contemporary, count=226}, {name=books, count=221}, {name=read-in-2011, count=219}, {name=4-stars, count=219}, {name=books-i-have, count=215}, {name=ya-lit, count=213}, {name=have, count=204}, {name=english, count=203}, {name=own-it, count=202}, {name=bookclub, count=200}, {name=reviewed, count=195}, {name=borrowed, count=193}, {name=gothic, count=189}, {name=read-2017, count=186}, {name=ya-books, count=178}, {name=favorite-books, count=178}, {name=2016-reading-challenge, count=177}, {name=coming-of-age, count=175}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=173}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=172}, {name=suspense, count=170}, {name=read-in-2018, count=169}, {name=e-book, count=169}, {name=e-books, count=169}, {name=audio-books, count=169}, {name=3-stars, count=168}, {name=creepy, count=167}, {name=read-2015, count=165}, {name=teen-fiction, count=165}, {name=photography, count=165}, {name=library-books, count=165}]","1"

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers.<br /> <br />At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.<br /> <br />Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against.<br /> <br />His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br /> <br />His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.<br /> <br /><i>Steve Jobs </i>is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.","472","2011-10-24","2011-10-01","1451648553","9781451648553","ebook","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1313467510l/11084141._SX98_.jpg","Simon & Schuster",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=995172}, {name=currently-reading, count=32027}, {name=biography, count=6556}, {name=non-fiction, count=3375}, {name=biographies, count=1784}, {name=business, count=1713}, {name=favorites, count=1638}, {name=nonfiction, count=1115}, {name=owned, count=691}, {name=technology, count=483}, {name=bio, count=408}, {name=history, count=406}, {name=audiobook, count=382}, {name=biography-memoir, count=367}, {name=books-i-own, count=341}, {name=kindle, count=311}, {name=audiobooks, count=305}, {name=leadership, count=225}, {name=none, count=220}, {name=audible, count=217}, {name=memoir, count=198}, {name=tech, count=195}, {name=ebook, count=193}, {name=autobiography, count=191}, {name=audio, count=185}, {name=to-buy, count=183}, {name=steve-jobs, count=176}, {name=bios, count=174}, {name=library, count=167}, {name=my-books, count=156}, {name=book-club, count=156}, {name=owned-books, count=154}, {name=abandoned, count=152}, {name=apple, count=147}, {name=memoirs, count=138}, {name=default, count=134}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=131}, {name=entrepreneurship, count=130}, {name=memoir-biography, count=113}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=112}, {name=my-library, count=112}, {name=ebooks, count=108}, {name=biografie, count=103}, {name=biographical, count=101}, {name=books, count=97}, {name=audio-book, count=96}, {name=science, count=91}, {name=audio-books, count=90}, {name=favourites, count=89}, {name=auto-biography, count=87}, {name=on-hold, count=87}, {name=unfinished, count=83}, {name=biografia, count=83}, {name=english, count=83}, {name=read-in-2012, count=82}, {name=did-not-finish, count=81}, {name=biografias, count=80}, {name=design, count=80}, {name=people, count=78}, {name=innovation, count=78}, {name=computers, count=77}, {name=steve, count=75}, {name=management, count=72}, {name=dnf, count=70}, {name=wish-list, count=67}, {name=business-books, count=64}, {name=inspirational, count=59}, {name=1, count=58}, {name=bookshelf, count=56}, {name=inspiration, count=56}, {name=maybe, count=55}, {name=e-book, count=53}, {name=biographies-and-memoirs, count=53}, {name=history-biography, count=52}, {name=bio-memoir, count=51}, {name=self-help, count=49}, {name=stopped-reading, count=49}, {name=read-2012, count=49}, {name=finished, count=48}, {name=favorite, count=47}, {name=autobiographies, count=47}, {name=must-read, count=47}, {name=home-library, count=47}, {name=to-read-non-fiction, count=47}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=46}, {name=listened, count=45}, {name=biography-memoirs, count=45}, {name=jobs, count=44}, {name=biographie, count=44}, {name=paused, count=43}, {name=listened-to, count=43}, {name=recommended, count=43}, {name=i-own, count=43}, {name=never-finished, count=42}, {name=my-shelf, count=42}, {name=startup, count=41}, {name=memoirs-biographies, count=40}, {name=to-read-nonfiction, count=40}, {name=e-books, count=40}, {name=work, count=40}]","1"

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. <br /><br />Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. <br /><br />What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. <br /><br />For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.","288","2006-01-17","2005-03-01","074324754X","9780743247542","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SX98_.jpg","Scribner",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=447428}, {name=currently-reading, count=16863}, {name=favorites, count=8181}, {name=non-fiction, count=6851}, {name=memoir, count=6114}, {name=book-club, count=3553}, {name=nonfiction, count=3451}, {name=memoirs, count=2404}, {name=biography, count=1770}, {name=books-i-own, count=1201}, {name=fiction, count=1081}, {name=owned, count=928}, {name=biography-memoir, count=744}, {name=autobiography, count=744}, {name=bookclub, count=625}, {name=adult, count=545}, {name=favourites, count=471}, {name=audiobook, count=439}, {name=memoir-biography, count=435}, {name=biographies, count=406}, {name=audiobooks, count=399}, {name=book-club-books, count=377}, {name=library, count=360}, {name=contemporary, count=320}, {name=school, count=318}, {name=owned-books, count=307}, {name=family, count=287}, {name=audio, count=269}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=267}, {name=to-buy, count=264}, {name=favorite-books, count=261}, {name=classics, count=241}, {name=kindle, count=240}, {name=poverty, count=234}, {name=book-club-reads, count=229}, {name=coming-of-age, count=219}, {name=book-group, count=205}, {name=my-library, count=178}, {name=my-books, count=166}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=166}, {name=autobiography-memoir, count=165}, {name=memoirs-biographies, count=161}, {name=my-favorites, count=157}, {name=read-in-2018, count=153}, {name=bio-memoir, count=151}, {name=read-in-2017, count=149}, {name=memoir-autobiography, count=147}, {name=audio-books, count=144}, {name=favorite, count=139}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=138}, {name=5-stars, count=133}, {name=read-for-school, count=133}, {name=memoir-bio, count=131}, {name=novels, count=129}, {name=survival, count=128}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=126}, {name=faves, count=123}, {name=own-it, count=122}, {name=school-books, count=122}, {name=recommended, count=121}, {name=bio, count=121}, {name=audio-book, count=121}, {name=adult-fiction, count=121}, {name=dysfunctional-families, count=119}, {name=abandoned, count=116}, {name=read-2017, count=116}, {name=alcoholism, count=115}, {name=non-fic, count=115}, {name=i-own, count=115}, {name=finished, count=114}, {name=ebook, count=110}, {name=mental-illness, count=110}, {name=dnf, count=107}, {name=abuse, count=104}, {name=for-school, count=102}, {name=mental-health, count=102}, {name=high-school, count=102}, {name=wish-list, count=101}, {name=american, count=100}, {name=audible, count=99}, {name=biographical, count=98}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=98}, {name=did-not-finish, count=97}, {name=female-authors, count=95}, {name=ebooks, count=91}, {name=psychology, count=90}, {name=read-2018, count=90}, {name=literature, count=90}, {name=re-read, count=89}, {name=young-adult, count=88}, {name=recommendations, count=88}, {name=adult-non-fiction, count=87}, {name=default, count=86}, {name=women, count=85}, {name=drama, count=85}, {name=read-in-2020, count=85}, {name=tbr, count=84}, {name=read-in-2019, count=84}, {name=bookshelf, count=83}, {name=borrowed, count=80}]","1"

There, in the unlikeliest of places, Mary discovers and helps restore an abandoned garden and, in the process, blossoms herself into a creature of loving kindness. Mary’s transformation begins when she meets a no-nonsense housekeeper, a brusque gardener, and a sprightly robin that leads her to the hidden garden. With the help of Dickon, a boy with an almost supernatural affinity for animals and plants, and Colin, her frail cousin, Mary works in secret to bring new life to the old garden. The three friends find their efforts rewarded not only with all the pleasure that blooming flowers bring, but also the blessings of good health and high spirits.<br />Since its initial appearance in 1911, this cherished classic of children’s literature by the author of A Little Princess has enchanted readers. Now available in this unabridged, modestly priced edition, The Secret Garden will continue to charm modern readers of all ages.","256","1999-06-10","1910-01-01","0486407845","9780486407845","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418788233l/2996._SX98_.jpg","Dover Publications",,,,"[{name=to-read, count=397021}, {name=classics, count=17092}, {name=currently-reading, count=15254}, {name=favorites, count=6719}, {name=fiction, count=5428}, {name=childrens, count=3330}, {name=classic, count=3055}, {name=children, count=2304}, {name=young-adult, count=2127}, {name=books-i-own, count=2007}, {name=owned, count=1880}, {name=children-s, count=1650}, {name=childhood, count=1386}, {name=children-s-books, count=1274}, {name=historical-fiction, count=1102}, {name=kids, count=917}, {name=middle-grade, count=833}, {name=favourites, count=806}, {name=ya, count=776}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=718}, {name=kindle, count=707}, {name=childrens-books, count=704}, {name=owned-books, count=564}, {name=literature, count=490}, {name=fantasy, count=479}, {name=historical, count=467}, {name=audiobook, count=453}, {name=kids-books, count=420}, {name=children-s-literature, count=411}, {name=audiobooks, count=383}, {name=childhood-books, count=380}, {name=novels, count=363}, {name=children-s-lit, count=351}, {name=re-read, count=345}, {name=my-books, count=330}, {name=classic-literature, count=323}, {name=library, count=317}, {name=british, count=312}, {name=my-library, count=306}, {name=juvenile, count=302}, {name=england, count=294}, {name=to-buy, count=292}, {name=book-club, count=288}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=286}, {name=ebook, count=284}, {name=childrens-lit, count=270}, {name=youth, count=261}, {name=default, count=257}, {name=childrens-literature, count=246}, {name=school, count=232}, {name=childhood-reads, count=229}, {name=classics-to-read, count=228}, {name=audio, count=222}, {name=english, count=221}, {name=novel, count=209}, {name=i-own, count=200}, {name=children-s-classics, count=200}, {name=reread, count=198}, {name=juvenile-fiction, count=193}, {name=20th-century, count=188}, {name=ebooks, count=188}, {name=coming-of-age, count=182}, {name=childhood-favourites, count=180}, {name=favorite, count=178}, {name=read-aloud, count=178}, {name=children-books, count=175}, {name=own-it, count=171}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=169}, {name=childrens-classics, count=167}, {name=friendship, count=165}, {name=british-literature, count=165}, {name=tbr, count=163}, {name=favorite-books, count=160}, {name=children-s-fiction, count=159}, {name=adventure, count=149}, {name=home-library, count=147}, {name=read-as-a-kid, count=145}, {name=childrens-fiction, count=145}, {name=kid-lit, count=139}, {name=mystery, count=137}, {name=classic-lit, count=136}, {name=read-in-2020, count=134}, {name=children-young-adult, count=132}, {name=audio-books, count=132}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=127}, {name=read-alouds, count=127}, {name=books, count=124}, {name=owned-tbr, count=123}, {name=classici, count=122}, {name=bookshelf, count=122}, {name=wish-list, count=120}, {name=5-stars, count=120}, {name=children-ya, count=119}, {name=family, count=118}, {name=audible, count=117}, {name=classic-fiction, count=117}, {name=my-favorites, count=116}, {name=to-re-read, count=116}, {name=to-reread, count=115}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=113}]","1"

L'albero invece è sempre lì, immutabile e disponibile. Felicità, tristezza, amore avrebbero potuto essere sentimenti vissuti allo stesso modo da un uomo e da un albero, poiché entrambi sono parte della natura. Ma gli equilibri sono stati alterati e l'amore incondizionato, la capacità di donare e di accettare l'altro in qualsiasi fase della sua vita sono rimaste prerogative di pochi: dei veri eroi del nostro tempo.","62","2000-05-01","1964-01-01","887782719X","9788877827197",,"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1354228639l/30143._SX98_.jpg","Salani",,,"ita","[{name=to-read, count=327773}, {name=to-read, count=5846}, {name=currently-reading, count=5074}, {name=favorites, count=4451}, {name=childrens, count=4020}, {name=children, count=2849}, {name=picture-books, count=2617}, {name=children-s-books, count=2608}, {name=classics, count=2547}, {name=fiction, count=2495}, {name=children-s, count=2240}, {name=poetry, count=1811}, {name=kids, count=1534}, {name=childhood, count=1436}, {name=childrens-books, count=1350}, {name=kids-books, count=959}, {name=childhood-favorites, count=631}, {name=picture-book, count=584}, {name=classic, count=567}, {name=young-adult, count=515}, {name=children-s-literature, count=440}, {name=books-i-own, count=418}, {name=owned, count=408}, {name=children-s-lit, count=407}, {name=childhood-books, count=401}, {name=children-books, count=374}, {name=fantasy, count=284}, {name=childrens-lit, count=242}, {name=to-buy, count=218}, {name=childhood-reads, count=214}, {name=youth, count=201}, {name=juvenile, count=199}, {name=ya, count=197}, {name=friendship, count=193}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=192}, {name=kid-books, count=187}, {name=childrens-literature, count=179}, {name=favourites, count=170}, {name=short-stories, count=151}, {name=favorite, count=147}, {name=shel-silverstein, count=143}, {name=children-s-book, count=142}, {name=currently-reading, count=137}, {name=kid-lit, count=136}, {name=favorite-books, count=128}, {name=middle-grade, count=126}, {name=5-stars, count=125}, {name=read-as-a-kid, count=119}, {name=library, count=117}, {name=literature, count=116}, {name=nostalgia, count=116}, {name=elementary, count=114}, {name=owned-books, count=112}, {name=my-childhood, count=110}, {name=favorite-children-s-books, count=110}, {name=inspirational, count=110}, {name=kiddos, count=107}, {name=philosophy, count=107}, {name=picture, count=104}, {name=children-young-adult, count=103}, {name=love, count=102}, {name=my-favorites, count=101}, {name=re-read, count=99}, {name=illustrated, count=97}, {name=books, count=97}, {name=for-the-kids, count=95}, {name=kid-s-books, count=94}, {name=school, count=93}, {name=children-s-picture-books, count=93}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=92}, {name=childhood-faves, count=92}, {name=english, count=89}, {name=childrens-book, count=89}, {name=read-as-a-child, count=86}, {name=default, count=84}, {name=my-books, count=83}, {name=childrens-fiction, count=82}, {name=children-ya, count=81}, {name=picturebooks, count=81}, {name=childhood-memories, count=80}, {name=books-from-my-childhood, count=77}, {name=childrens-picture-books, count=77}, {name=for-kids, count=77}, {name=the-giving-tree, count=76}, {name=elementary-school, count=76}, {name=children-s-fiction, count=75}, {name=ebook, count=73}, {name=banned-books, count=73}, {name=own-it, count=72}, {name=nature, count=71}, {name=childrensbooks, count=70}, {name=read-aloud, count=69}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=68}, {name=juvenile-fiction, count=67}, {name=classroom, count=66}, {name=childhood-favs, count=66}, {name=read-in-english, count=65}, {name=i-own, count=65}, {name=5-star, count=65}, {name=books-i-read-as-a-kid, count=64}]","1"

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of <i>Into the Wild</i>.<br /><br />Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.","207","1997-01-20","1996-01-01","0385486804","9780385486804","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403173986l/1845._SX98_.jpg","Anchor Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=490612}, {name=currently-reading, count=10431}, {name=non-fiction, count=8404}, {name=favorites, count=4101}, {name=nonfiction, count=3492}, {name=biography, count=2662}, {name=adventure, count=1459}, {name=travel, count=1439}, {name=owned, count=890}, {name=books-i-own, count=811}, {name=classics, count=674}, {name=fiction, count=575}, {name=memoir, count=519}, {name=nature, count=484}, {name=school, count=398}, {name=biography-memoir, count=393}, {name=biographies, count=387}, {name=survival, count=346}, {name=book-club, count=310}, {name=alaska, count=292}, {name=audiobook, count=275}, {name=owned-books, count=265}, {name=outdoors, count=265}, {name=library, count=262}, {name=favourites, count=259}, {name=memoirs, count=251}, {name=audiobooks, count=248}, {name=history, count=238}, {name=to-buy, count=221}, {name=adult, count=218}, {name=kindle, count=199}, {name=memoir-biography, count=183}, {name=contemporary, count=171}, {name=audio, count=166}, {name=read-for-school, count=164}, {name=my-library, count=159}, {name=my-books, count=152}, {name=school-books, count=137}, {name=journalism, count=136}, {name=for-school, count=134}, {name=high-school, count=133}, {name=american, count=125}, {name=novels, count=122}, {name=default, count=121}, {name=ebook, count=119}, {name=philosophy, count=118}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=110}, {name=english, count=109}, {name=wish-list, count=109}, {name=literature, count=107}, {name=biographical, count=106}, {name=favorite-books, count=105}, {name=wilderness, count=100}, {name=bio, count=99}, {name=i-own, count=99}, {name=non-fic, count=98}, {name=classic, count=97}, {name=environment, count=92}, {name=dnf, count=85}, {name=did-not-finish, count=85}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=83}, {name=usa, count=82}, {name=true-story, count=81}, {name=abandoned, count=81}, {name=autobiography, count=79}, {name=read-in-2016, count=76}, {name=re-read, count=76}, {name=travel-adventure, count=76}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=75}, {name=read-in-2015, count=74}, {name=books, count=74}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=73}, {name=favorite, count=72}, {name=young-adult, count=72}, {name=20th-century, count=71}, {name=bio-memoir, count=70}, {name=audio-book, count=69}, {name=bookshelf, count=68}, {name=own-it, count=68}, {name=true-stories, count=66}, {name=home-library, count=66}, {name=borrowed, count=64}, {name=movies, count=63}, {name=audio-books, count=63}, {name=ebooks, count=62}, {name=jon-krakauer, count=62}, {name=wanderlust, count=62}, {name=novel, count=61}, {name=memoirs-biographies, count=61}, {name=nonfic, count=61}, {name=american-literature, count=60}, {name=bookclub, count=60}, {name=adult-nonfiction, count=60}, {name=tbr, count=59}, {name=to-read-non-fiction, count=59}, {name=coming-of-age, count=58}, {name=death, count=58}, {name=school-reads, count=56}, {name=read-in-2020, count=55}, {name=audible, count=55}]","1"

Instead of traditional lessons, she grew up learning how to stew herbs into medicine, scavenging in the family scrap yard and helping her family prepare for the apocalypse.

Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an “outlander”—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of Our Lord...1743.<br /> <br />Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life, and shatter her heart. For here James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire—and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.","850","2005-07-26","1991-06-01","0440242940","9780440242949","Mass Market Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529065012l/10964._SX98_.jpg","Dell Publishing Company","43943","Outlander","eng","[{name=to-read, count=519531}, {name=currently-reading, count=57504}, {name=to-read, count=21717}, {name=historical-fiction, count=11242}, {name=favorites, count=9960}, {name=romance, count=8022}, {name=fantasy, count=7071}, {name=fiction, count=5239}, {name=time-travel, count=3545}, {name=historical, count=3343}, {name=historical-romance, count=2122}, {name=series, count=2085}, {name=books-i-own, count=2036}, {name=owned, count=1668}, {name=dnf, count=1262}, {name=adult, count=1131}, {name=kindle, count=1124}, {name=audiobook, count=991}, {name=outlander, count=949}, {name=audiobooks, count=876}, {name=scotland, count=842}, {name=did-not-finish, count=774}, {name=favourites, count=761}, {name=diana-gabaldon, count=737}, {name=adventure, count=718}, {name=science-fiction, count=698}, {name=book-club, count=686}, {name=abandoned, count=641}, {name=audible, count=628}, {name=history, count=576}, {name=adult-fiction, count=572}, {name=audio, count=546}, {name=owned-books, count=533}, {name=sci-fi, count=496}, {name=ebook, count=480}, {name=library, count=450}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=375}, {name=re-read, count=370}, {name=tbr, count=356}, {name=chick-lit, count=342}, {name=ebooks, count=326}, {name=read-in-2014, count=319}, {name=paranormal, count=318}, {name=outlander-series, count=316}, {name=to-buy, count=314}, {name=read-in-2015, count=298}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=292}, {name=my-library, count=291}, {name=audio-books, count=285}, {name=my-books, count=284}, {name=default, count=274}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=274}, {name=novels, count=255}, {name=favorite, count=253}, {name=5-stars, count=246}, {name=audio-book, count=244}, {name=read-in-2016, count=239}, {name=on-hold, count=235}, {name=unfinished, count=234}, {name=great-american-read, count=233}, {name=favorite-books, count=221}, {name=i-own, count=220}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=215}, {name=e-book, count=207}, {name=own-it, count=193}, {name=read-in-2017, count=192}, {name=18th-century, count=188}, {name=owned-tbr, count=187}, {name=historical-fantasy, count=186}, {name=read-2014, count=181}, {name=drama, count=178}, {name=maybe, count=171}, {name=highlander, count=168}, {name=read-2015, count=165}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=165}, {name=couldn-t-finish, count=162}, {name=gave-up-on, count=158}, {name=my-favorites, count=155}, {name=magic, count=153}, {name=reread, count=153}, {name=wish-list, count=152}, {name=romance-historical, count=151}, {name=fiction-historical, count=149}, {name=kindle-books, count=148}, {name=e-books, count=145}, {name=physical-tbr, count=145}, {name=highlanders, count=142}, {name=read-in-2020, count=142}, {name=bookshelf, count=142}, {name=nook, count=141}, {name=recommended, count=141}, {name=gabaldon, count=140}, {name=love, count=139}, {name=paranormal-romance, count=139}, {name=faves, count=137}, {name=favorite-series, count=135}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=131}, {name=first-in-series, count=130}, {name=historic-fiction, count=130}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=129}]","1"

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:<br /><br />""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""<br /><br />When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","264","2004-05-03","1939-11-06","0312330871","9780312330873","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391120695l/16299._SX98_.jpg","St. Martin's Press",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=596004}, {name=currently-reading, count=20390}, {name=mystery, count=13347}, {name=favorites, count=8988}, {name=classics, count=7154}, {name=fiction, count=5913}, {name=agatha-christie, count=2647}, {name=crime, count=2500}, {name=thriller, count=2099}, {name=owned, count=1744}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=1633}, {name=books-i-own, count=1488}, {name=classic, count=1224}, {name=book-club, count=1071}, {name=favourites, count=993}, {name=mysteries, count=938}, {name=audiobook, count=761}, {name=audiobooks, count=724}, {name=adult, count=702}, {name=suspense, count=675}, {name=library, count=503}, {name=novels, count=500}, {name=kindle, count=492}, {name=ebook, count=488}, {name=detective, count=475}, {name=owned-books, count=431}, {name=british, count=416}, {name=mystery-suspense, count=408}, {name=to-buy, count=398}, {name=school, count=356}, {name=murder-mystery, count=353}, {name=audio, count=352}, {name=crime-mystery, count=335}, {name=adult-fiction, count=335}, {name=5-stars, count=325}, {name=mystery-crime, count=317}, {name=great-american-read, count=312}, {name=horror, count=295}, {name=thrillers, count=294}, {name=thriller-mystery, count=277}, {name=crime-fiction, count=272}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=269}, {name=my-library, count=256}, {name=english, count=252}, {name=default, count=245}, {name=re-read, count=240}, {name=my-books, count=239}, {name=20th-century, count=227}, {name=novel, count=225}, {name=drama, count=218}, {name=favorite, count=216}, {name=literature, count=216}, {name=read-in-2020, count=213}, {name=favorite-books, count=212}, {name=read-in-2017, count=209}, {name=read-in-2016, count=207}, {name=crime-thriller, count=203}, {name=read-in-2018, count=200}, {name=england, count=198}, {name=ebooks, count=197}, {name=read-in-2019, count=190}, {name=audio-books, count=190}, {name=murder, count=190}, {name=tbr, count=180}, {name=agatha, count=179}, {name=british-literature, count=177}, {name=christie, count=174}, {name=read-for-school, count=171}, {name=gialli, count=170}, {name=stand-alone, count=166}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=165}, {name=audible, count=165}, {name=i-own, count=164}, {name=must-read, count=161}, {name=faves, count=160}, {name=recommended, count=151}, {name=mistery, count=150}, {name=books, count=149}, {name=favoritos, count=146}, {name=bookclub, count=145}, {name=2020-reads, count=143}, {name=historical-fiction, count=141}, {name=my-favorites, count=141}, {name=read-2020, count=139}, {name=audio-book, count=138}, {name=4-stars, count=136}, {name=reread, count=134}, {name=read-in-2015, count=133}, {name=female-author, count=132}, {name=female-authors, count=130}, {name=mystery-thriller-horror, count=130}, {name=five-stars, count=130}, {name=bookshelf, count=129}, {name=e-book, count=128}, {name=crime-mystery-thriller, count=128}, {name=1930s, count=124}, {name=own-it, count=120}, {name=favs, count=118}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=118}, {name=read-2018, count=117}]","1"

The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. <br /><br />But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?<br /><br />","300","2012-09-23","2012-09-27",,,"ebook","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349001400l/16046182._SX98_.jpg","Autopublished","176319","The Martian","eng","[{name=to-read, count=426167}, {name=currently-reading, count=23759}, {name=science-fiction, count=12354}, {name=favorites, count=12020}, {name=sci-fi, count=11377}, {name=fiction, count=8768}, {name=owned, count=2428}, {name=scifi, count=2146}, {name=books-i-own, count=1840}, {name=audiobook, count=1719}, {name=book-club, count=1676}, {name=audiobooks, count=1462}, {name=read-in-2015, count=1292}, {name=adventure, count=1259}, {name=kindle, count=1217}, {name=favourites, count=1203}, {name=science, count=1047}, {name=space, count=1027}, {name=adult, count=1005}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=863}, {name=thriller, count=815}, {name=audible, count=795}, {name=audio, count=738}, {name=ebook, count=736}, {name=read-2015, count=700}, {name=humor, count=661}, {name=library, count=636}, {name=survival, count=613}, {name=adult-fiction, count=577}, {name=read-in-2016, count=574}, {name=sf, count=560}, {name=owned-books, count=542}, {name=novels, count=496}, {name=fantasy, count=454}, {name=to-buy, count=441}, {name=dnf, count=435}, {name=contemporary, count=420}, {name=ebooks, count=363}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=362}, {name=audio-books, count=360}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=344}, {name=read-2016, count=341}, {name=abandoned, count=333}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=322}, {name=audio-book, count=317}, {name=5-stars, count=315}, {name=funny, count=305}, {name=did-not-finish, count=296}, {name=2015-reads, count=296}, {name=bookclub, count=291}, {name=my-books, count=278}, {name=suspense, count=276}, {name=novel, count=276}, {name=e-book, count=270}, {name=mars, count=255}, {name=english, count=253}, {name=tbr, count=253}, {name=my-library, count=249}, {name=read-in-2014, count=245}, {name=great-american-read, count=243}, {name=default, count=243}, {name=favorite-books, count=239}, {name=2015-books, count=237}, {name=science-fiction-fantasy, count=237}, {name=read-in-2017, count=234}, {name=favorite, count=230}, {name=stand-alone, count=230}, {name=books, count=224}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=213}, {name=reviewed, count=205}, {name=i-own, count=194}, {name=recommended, count=185}, {name=faves, count=184}, {name=read-in-2018, count=181}, {name=2015-read, count=177}, {name=humour, count=172}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=171}, {name=american, count=166}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=161}, {name=2016-reads, count=160}, {name=2015-reading-challenge, count=159}, {name=bookshelf, count=159}, {name=sci-fi-and-fantasy, count=154}, {name=read-in-english, count=153}, {name=standalone, count=153}, {name=fantasy-scifi, count=152}, {name=e-books, count=149}, {name=5-star, count=147}, {name=4-stars, count=146}, {name=drama, count=146}, {name=2016-reading-challenge, count=144}, {name=borrowed, count=142}, {name=action, count=142}, {name=read-in-2019, count=141}, {name=read-2014, count=140}, {name=book-to-movie, count=138}, {name=wish-list, count=137}, {name=andy-weir, count=136}, {name=own-it, count=135}, {name=read-in-2020, count=133}]","1"

It was a time when injustice was met by a lust for vengeance, and rarely was a distinction made between the innocent and the guilty. Against this tumultuous historical backdrop, Dickens' great story of unsurpassed adventure and courage unfolds.<br /><br />Unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, Dr. Alexandre Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and safely transported from France to England. It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman — Charles Darnay — falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay from certain doom more than once. Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine.<br /><br />--back cover","293","1999-01-01","1859-11-26","0486406512","9780486406510","Mass Market Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523150494l/1952._SY160_.jpg","Dover Publications",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=587577}, {name=currently-reading, count=51545}, {name=to-read, count=28577}, {name=classics, count=21145}, {name=fiction, count=7373}, {name=favorites, count=5003}, {name=classic, count=3539}, {name=historical-fiction, count=3431}, {name=owned, count=2118}, {name=books-i-own, count=1855}, {name=literature, count=1499}, {name=kindle, count=885}, {name=historical, count=862}, {name=novels, count=749}, {name=school, count=699}, {name=classic-literature, count=629}, {name=classics-to-read, count=586}, {name=clàssics, count=585}, {name=owned-books, count=577}, {name=19th-century, count=484}, {name=charles-dickens, count=481}, {name=british, count=459}, {name=history, count=452}, {name=dickens, count=431}, {name=france, count=403}, {name=my-ebooks, count=372}, {name=library, count=367}, {name=to-buy, count=363}, {name=audiobook, count=363}, {name=my-library, count=358}, {name=novel, count=353}, {name=english, count=349}, {name=favourites, count=345}, {name=high-school, count=336}, {name=1001-books, count=328}, {name=audiobooks, count=324}, {name=read-for-school, count=317}, {name=my-books, count=307}, {name=tbr, count=300}, {name=book-club, count=300}, {name=romance, count=299}, {name=british-literature, count=295}, {name=adult, count=291}, {name=ebook, count=289}, {name=classic-fiction, count=289}, {name=victorian, count=280}, {name=default, count=275}, {name=england, count=274}, {name=audible, count=258}, {name=school-books, count=254}, {name=ebooks, count=253}, {name=to-read-classics, count=252}, {name=classic-lit, count=248}, {name=literary-fiction, count=248}, {name=english-literature, count=244}, {name=audio, count=236}, {name=french-revolution, count=231}, {name=for-school, count=231}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=230}, {name=abandoned, count=223}, {name=re-read, count=219}, {name=i-own, count=208}, {name=classics-tbr, count=200}, {name=dnf, count=197}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=194}, {name=adult-fiction, count=192}, {name=the-classics, count=192}, {name=1001, count=190}, {name=did-not-finish, count=170}, {name=drama, count=167}, {name=literary, count=167}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=162}, {name=unfinished, count=161}, {name=owned-tbr, count=151}, {name=tbr-classics, count=150}, {name=e-books, count=147}, {name=bookshelf, count=146}, {name=home-library, count=144}, {name=to-re-read, count=144}, {name=books, count=143}, {name=general-fiction, count=143}, {name=europe, count=143}, {name=british-lit, count=143}, {name=kindle-books, count=136}, {name=own-it, count=136}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=135}, {name=on-hold, count=134}, {name=brit-lit, count=134}, {name=have, count=131}, {name=physical-tbr, count=129}, {name=fiction-classics, count=125}, {name=favorite-books, count=125}, {name=must-read, count=124}, {name=war, count=123}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=117}, {name=read-in-school, count=115}, {name=e-book, count=113}, {name=nook, count=113}, {name=favorite, count=112}, {name=paris, count=110}]","1"

Hon blir anklagad för trippelmord och dras in i en härva som leder tillbaka till hennes mörka förflutna.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander återkommer till Sverige efter en längre tids vistelse utomlands. Tack vare finansmannen Wennerströms pengar har hon det bättre ställt än någonsin, men hon återvänder till ett Stockholm där hon inte längre har familj eller vänner. Lisbeth är helt ensam i världen. En rad dramatiska händelser inträffar som får Lisbeths mörka förflutna att göra sig påmint, och när hon dras in i en mördarjakt där hon själv är villebråd bestämmer hon sig för att göra upp med det förgångna en gång för alla. Hon ska straffa dem som förtjänar att straffas.<br /><br />Samtidigt har Mikael Blomkvist på Millennium fått korn på hett nyhetsstoff. Journalisten Dag Svensson och hans sambo Mia Bergman kan visa avslöjande fakta om en omfattande sexhandel mellan Östeuropa och Sverige. Många av de personer som utpekas i traffickinghärvan har högt uppsatta positioner i samhället.<br />När Dag och Mia blir brutalt mördade och misstankarna riktas mot Salander bestämmer sig Mikael Blomkvist för att driva sin egen utredning. Han upptäcker snart ett samband mellan morden och traffickingtemat. Den fruktade Zala, vars namn ständigt förekommer i utredningen, visar sig dessutom ha kopplingar till en viss Lisbeth Salander...<br />Det är dags för Blomkvist och Salander att mötas igen.<br /><br />Flickan som lekte med elden är andra delen i Stieg Larssons Milllennium-trilogi. Den första delen, Män som hatar kvinnor, blev en stor framgång och väckte mycket uppmärksamhet.<br />Den tredje delen kommer sommaren 2007 och har titeln ""Luftslottet som sprängdes"".","632","2006-05-09","2006-05-09","9113015303","9789113015309","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434300230l/1512204._SX98_.jpg","Norstedts","44598","Millennium","swe","[{name=to-read, count=196330}, {name=currently-reading, count=11515}, {name=fiction, count=7889}, {name=mystery, count=6151}, {name=favorites, count=4998}, {name=thriller, count=4327}, {name=to-read, count=3000}, {name=crime, count=2806}, {name=owned, count=2105}, {name=books-i-own, count=1825}, {name=series, count=1560}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=1205}, {name=suspense, count=1001}, {name=kindle, count=773}, {name=default, count=685}, {name=contemporary, count=647}, {name=audiobook, count=596}, {name=sweden, count=581}, {name=adult, count=575}, {name=owned-books, count=571}, {name=crime-thriller, count=524}, {name=stieg-larsson, count=520}, {name=thrillers, count=519}, {name=audiobooks, count=478}, {name=adult-fiction, count=433}, {name=ebook, count=433}, {name=novels, count=425}, {name=mysteries, count=420}, {name=favourites, count=415}, {name=library, count=384}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=371}, {name=my-books, count=366}, {name=crime-fiction, count=365}, {name=my-library, count=340}, {name=mystery-suspense, count=331}, {name=audio, count=321}, {name=crime-mystery, count=301}, {name=scandinavian, count=299}, {name=drama, count=298}, {name=read-in-2010, count=291}, {name=swedish, count=262}, {name=book-club, count=255}, {name=read-in-2011, count=242}, {name=mystery-crime, count=233}, {name=detective, count=228}, {name=i-own, count=228}, {name=general-fiction, count=225}, {name=novel, count=208}, {name=ebooks, count=208}, {name=thriller-mystery, count=203}, {name=audio-books, count=200}, {name=audible, count=193}, {name=5-stars, count=180}, {name=read-in-2012, count=177}, {name=millennium, count=176}, {name=suspense-thriller, count=174}, {name=read-2010, count=172}, {name=own-it, count=172}, {name=translated, count=171}, {name=to-buy, count=158}, {name=audio-book, count=156}, {name=adventure, count=156}, {name=scandinavia, count=150}, {name=thriller-suspense, count=150}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=149}, {name=bookshelf, count=148}, {name=finished, count=147}, {name=borrowed, count=147}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=146}, {name=favorite, count=145}, {name=dark, count=140}, {name=have, count=138}, {name=books, count=136}, {name=nordic-noir, count=135}, {name=action, count=135}, {name=murder-mystery, count=130}, {name=home-library, count=125}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=122}, {name=murder, count=120}, {name=trilogy, count=120}, {name=europe, count=119}, {name=krimi, count=118}, {name=favorite-books, count=118}, {name=literature, count=117}, {name=tbr, count=114}, {name=faves, count=111}, {name=english, count=110}, {name=translation, count=110}, {name=lisbeth-salander, count=109}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=109}, {name=read-2011, count=108}, {name=recommended, count=106}, {name=e-book, count=106}, {name=crime-mystery-thriller, count=103}, {name=e-books, count=102}, {name=abandoned, count=99}, {name=nordic, count=98}, {name=paperback, count=97}, {name=millenium, count=96}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=96}]","1"

</b><br /><br />To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.<br /><br />As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?<br /><br />Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the third installment of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series The Mortal Instruments.","541","2009-03-24","2009-03-24","1416914307","9781416914303","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369452339l/3777732._SX98_.jpg","Margaret K.

Armani! Versace!</i> at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. <br /><br />THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>","360","2006-05-30","2003-04-15","0767925955","9780767925952","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320511725l/5140._SX98_.jpg","Broadway","105105","The Devil Wears Prada",,"[{name=to-read, count=220755}, {name=chick-lit, count=3487}, {name=currently-reading, count=3188}, {name=fiction, count=3003}, {name=books-i-own, count=816}, {name=contemporary, count=777}, {name=favorites, count=736}, {name=owned, count=632}, {name=romance, count=592}, {name=chicklit, count=476}, {name=adult, count=315}, {name=humor, count=307}, {name=chic-lit, count=256}, {name=adult-fiction, count=248}, {name=owned-books, count=227}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=201}, {name=fashion, count=192}, {name=series, count=171}, {name=novels, count=164}, {name=general-fiction, count=150}, {name=default, count=141}, {name=library, count=139}, {name=my-books, count=138}, {name=my-library, count=135}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=131}, {name=audiobook, count=122}, {name=audiobooks, count=116}, {name=movies, count=115}, {name=dnf, count=108}, {name=funny, count=99}, {name=movie, count=94}, {name=comedy, count=93}, {name=lauren-weisberger, count=92}, {name=novel, count=92}, {name=new-york, count=90}, {name=book-club, count=88}, {name=fluff, count=88}, {name=guilty-pleasures, count=87}, {name=beach-reads, count=85}, {name=i-own, count=85}, {name=to-buy, count=84}, {name=drama, count=84}, {name=audio, count=82}, {name=young-adult, count=80}, {name=2006, count=75}, {name=humour, count=74}, {name=contemporary-romance, count=71}, {name=abandoned, count=69}, {name=did-not-finish, count=69}, {name=book-to-movie, count=67}, {name=tbr, count=62}, {name=fun, count=58}, {name=kindle, count=58}, {name=english, count=58}, {name=american, count=57}, {name=girly, count=56}, {name=saw-the-movie, count=56}, {name=favourites, count=56}, {name=womens-fiction, count=55}, {name=women-s-fiction, count=54}, {name=books-to-movies, count=54}, {name=borrowed, count=53}, {name=own-it, count=52}, {name=books, count=50}, {name=home-library, count=48}, {name=female-authors, count=46}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=45}, {name=finished, count=44}, {name=ebooks, count=44}, {name=books-i-have, count=43}, {name=wish-list, count=43}, {name=paperback, count=42}, {name=nyc, count=42}, {name=female-author, count=41}, {name=bookshelf, count=40}, {name=ebook, count=40}, {name=other, count=39}, {name=light-reading, count=39}, {name=women, count=38}, {name=3-stars, count=38}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=38}, {name=personal-library, count=38}, {name=just-for-fun, count=37}, {name=audio-books, count=37}, {name=have, count=37}, {name=2003, count=36}, {name=made-into-movie, count=35}, {name=maybe, count=34}, {name=watched-the-movie, count=34}, {name=usa, count=34}, {name=made-into-movies, count=34}, {name=classics, count=34}, {name=books-made-into-movies, count=34}, {name=modern, count=33}, {name=gave-up-on, count=32}, {name=modern-fiction, count=32}, {name=literature, count=32}, {name=audible, count=31}, {name=audio-book, count=30}, {name=chick-books, count=30}]","1"

As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943.<br /><br />When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.","777","2010-11-16","2010-11-16","0375435018","9780375435010","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1552392878l/8147521._SX98_.jpg","Random House Large Print",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=494923}, {name=currently-reading, count=19567}, {name=non-fiction, count=6830}, {name=favorites, count=4846}, {name=history, count=4421}, {name=biography, count=3736}, {name=nonfiction, count=3166}, {name=book-club, count=2723}, {name=wwii, count=1115}, {name=war, count=1094}, {name=historical, count=860}, {name=audiobook, count=682}, {name=books-i-own, count=635}, {name=world-war-ii, count=632}, {name=owned, count=616}, {name=audiobooks, count=590}, {name=kindle, count=541}, {name=biographies, count=530}, {name=military, count=502}, {name=audio, count=484}, {name=memoir, count=466}, {name=biography-memoir, count=456}, {name=ww2, count=455}, {name=historical-fiction, count=430}, {name=survival, count=405}, {name=bookclub, count=378}, {name=adult, count=311}, {name=library, count=311}, {name=american-history, count=310}, {name=world-war-2, count=308}, {name=book-club-books, count=258}, {name=fiction, count=257}, {name=audio-books, count=234}, {name=audio-book, count=229}, {name=audible, count=226}, {name=memoirs, count=223}, {name=adventure, count=200}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=199}, {name=inspirational, count=191}, {name=japan, count=188}, {name=ebook, count=177}, {name=book-group, count=174}, {name=owned-books, count=169}, {name=memoir-biography, count=169}, {name=read-in-2015, count=163}, {name=favorite-books, count=161}, {name=book-club-reads, count=154}, {name=read-in-2014, count=151}, {name=abandoned, count=145}, {name=military-history, count=144}, {name=my-books, count=137}, {name=did-not-finish, count=135}, {name=to-buy, count=135}, {name=sports, count=131}, {name=read-in-2011, count=129}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=124}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=123}, {name=favorite, count=119}, {name=bio, count=114}, {name=christian, count=114}, {name=favourites, count=111}, {name=default, count=109}, {name=historical-non-fiction, count=104}, {name=my-library, count=103}, {name=5-stars, count=103}, {name=listened-to, count=103}, {name=recommended, count=101}, {name=read-in-2012, count=100}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=95}, {name=my-favorites, count=94}, {name=biographical, count=94}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=94}, {name=own-it, count=92}, {name=read-2015, count=91}, {name=true-story, count=91}, {name=ebooks, count=91}, {name=finished, count=89}, {name=wish-list, count=89}, {name=historical-nonfiction, count=88}, {name=louis-zamperini, count=84}, {name=laura-hillenbrand, count=84}, {name=unbroken, count=83}, {name=running, count=81}, {name=ww-ii, count=81}, {name=history-biography, count=80}, {name=adult-non-fiction, count=80}, {name=asia, count=80}, {name=2015-reading-challenge, count=78}, {name=dnf, count=77}, {name=autobiography, count=77}, {name=read-2014, count=76}, {name=school, count=75}, {name=read-in-2013, count=70}, {name=must-read, count=70}, {name=true-stories, count=70}, {name=bio-memoir, count=68}, {name=adult-nonfiction, count=67}, {name=to-read-non-fiction, count=67}, {name=japanese-prison-camp-experiences, count=66}, {name=e-book, count=65}]","1"

Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<p> Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book. </p><p> Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. ""This is a bad land for Gods,"" says Shadow.</p><p> More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>","635","2001-06-01","2001-06-19","0060010606","9780060010607","ebook","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1303478569l/4404._SX98_.jpg","PerfectBound (HarperCollins)","114135","American Gods","eng","[{name=to-read, count=541575}, {name=currently-reading, count=40937}, {name=fantasy, count=22194}, {name=favorites, count=9818}, {name=fiction, count=9392}, {name=owned, count=2882}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=2582}, {name=mythology, count=2395}, {name=books-i-own, count=1740}, {name=audiobook, count=1360}, {name=audiobooks, count=1171}, {name=science-fiction, count=1117}, {name=kindle, count=1032}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=1025}, {name=dnf, count=997}, {name=neil-gaiman, count=990}, {name=sci-fi, count=941}, {name=favourites, count=821}, {name=adult, count=784}, {name=contemporary, count=766}, {name=abandoned, count=765}, {name=book-club, count=746}, {name=did-not-finish, count=706}, {name=audio, count=661}, {name=novels, count=653}, {name=horror, count=636}, {name=library, count=624}, {name=owned-books, count=561}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=555}, {name=magical-realism, count=542}, {name=ebook, count=527}, {name=audible, count=453}, {name=supernatural, count=447}, {name=adventure, count=445}, {name=to-buy, count=438}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=424}, {name=adult-fiction, count=411}, {name=paranormal, count=395}, {name=series, count=375}, {name=read-in-2017, count=365}, {name=default, count=365}, {name=mystery, count=359}, {name=magic, count=355}, {name=unfinished, count=352}, {name=religion, count=349}, {name=gaiman, count=331}, {name=my-library, count=317}, {name=re-read, count=310}, {name=on-hold, count=309}, {name=english, count=292}, {name=ebooks, count=292}, {name=my-books, count=291}, {name=novel, count=281}, {name=audio-books, count=281}, {name=books, count=278}, {name=science-fiction-fantasy, count=276}, {name=tbr, count=268}, {name=classics, count=267}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=265}, {name=audio-book, count=246}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=237}, {name=literature, count=234}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=233}, {name=fantasy-scifi, count=228}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=228}, {name=gods, count=220}, {name=read-2017, count=210}, {name=modern-fantasy, count=204}, {name=wish-list, count=202}, {name=scifi, count=193}, {name=i-own, count=193}, {name=young-adult, count=187}, {name=read-in-2016, count=183}, {name=thriller, count=179}, {name=general-fiction, count=179}, {name=sff, count=177}, {name=favorite-books, count=176}, {name=british, count=173}, {name=e-book, count=170}, {name=favorite, count=169}, {name=reread, count=168}, {name=gave-up-on, count=168}, {name=sci-fi-and-fantasy, count=167}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=161}, {name=hugo-award, count=158}, {name=bookshelf, count=158}, {name=5-stars, count=155}, {name=read-in-2018, count=154}, {name=american, count=153}, {name=couldn-t-finish, count=153}, {name=hugo, count=153}, {name=fiction-fantasy, count=152}, {name=own-it, count=151}, {name=sf, count=150}, {name=home-library, count=150}, {name=recommended, count=148}, {name=fantasia, count=148}, {name=21st-century, count=145}, {name=read-in-2015, count=144}, {name=dropped, count=144}]","1"

It’s something every child should experience and every child will love. From Tom’s sly trickery with the whitewashed fence—when he cleverly manipulates everyone so they happily do his work for him—to his and Becky Thatcher’s calamities in Bat Cave, the enjoyment just never ends. The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch &amp; Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br /><br />Scott created these drawings in scratchboard ­ an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk.

  <i>Sometimes it's the little lies that turn out to be the most lethal...</i>
</b><br /><br /><b>A murder... a tragic accident...or just parents behaving badly?<br />What's indisputable is that someone is dead.<br />But who did what?</b><br /><br /><i>Big Little Lies</i> follows three women, each at a crossroads:<br /><br />Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beach-side community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest (<i>How </i>is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).<br /><br />Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.<br /><br />New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.<br /><br /><i>Big Little Lies</i> is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.","458","2014-07-29","2014-12-25","0399167064","9780399167065","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1594851437l/19486412._SX98_.jpg","Amy Einhorn Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=359848}, {name=to-read, count=40654}, {name=currently-reading, count=33177}, {name=fiction, count=5291}, {name=favorites, count=4002}, {name=mystery, count=2947}, {name=book-club, count=2475}, {name=contemporary, count=1650}, {name=chick-lit, count=1318}, {name=books-i-own, count=983}, {name=audiobook, count=909}, {name=audiobooks, count=839}, {name=adult, count=808}, {name=owned, count=779}, {name=thriller, count=716}, {name=kindle, count=687}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=643}, {name=adult-fiction, count=619}, {name=read-in-2017, count=582}, {name=audio, count=557}, {name=library, count=533}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=489}, {name=australia, count=486}, {name=favourites, count=428}, {name=read-in-2015, count=390}, {name=bookclub, count=370}, {name=drama, count=347}, {name=ebook, count=344}, {name=suspense, count=325}, {name=crime, count=320}, {name=read-in-2018, count=314}, {name=audible, count=301}, {name=read-2017, count=296}, {name=audio-books, count=283}, {name=liane-moriarty, count=277}, {name=book-club-books, count=245}, {name=general-fiction, count=234}, {name=audio-book, count=233}, {name=australian, count=230}, {name=to-buy, count=227}, {name=owned-books, count=226}, {name=novels, count=224}, {name=read-2015, count=224}, {name=read-in-2019, count=222}, {name=read-in-2016, count=222}, {name=read-in-2014, count=216}, {name=5-stars, count=211}, {name=friendship, count=200}, {name=ebooks, count=191}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=185}, {name=read-2019, count=184}, {name=family, count=183}, {name=my-books, count=182}, {name=tbr, count=178}, {name=2017-reads, count=176}, {name=dnf, count=176}, {name=2017-books, count=170}, {name=thrillers, count=169}, {name=book-club-reads, count=163}, {name=did-not-finish, count=159}, {name=read-2018, count=155}, {name=abuse, count=142}, {name=romance, count=142}, {name=humor, count=139}, {name=women-s-fiction, count=139}, {name=my-library, count=138}, {name=mystery-suspense, count=134}, {name=2015-books, count=133}, {name=read-2016, count=132}, {name=thriller-mystery, count=130}, {name=2015-reads, count=129}, {name=2019-reads, count=127}, {name=library-books, count=125}, {name=e-book, count=125}, {name=read-in-2020, count=125}, {name=mysteries, count=124}, {name=2018-reads, count=123}, {name=womens-fiction, count=123}, {name=read-2014, count=123}, {name=favorite-books, count=120}, {name=novel, count=117}, {name=recommended, count=116}, {name=abandoned, count=114}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=109}, {name=stand-alone, count=108}, {name=beach-reads, count=108}, {name=2017-read, count=106}, {name=faves, count=104}, {name=4-stars, count=103}, {name=library-book, count=102}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=101}, {name=2019-books, count=101}, {name=2015-reading-challenge, count=100}, {name=chicklit, count=99}, {name=i-own, count=99}, {name=e-books, count=98}, {name=borrowed, count=98}, {name=2018-books, count=97}, {name=favorite, count=97}, {name=funny, count=97}]","1"

</b><br /><br />Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.<br /><br />To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?<br /><br />In this breathtaking sequel to <i>City of Bones</i>, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.","453","2008-03-25","2008-03-25","1416914293","9781416914297","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432730356l/1582996._SX98_.jpg","Margaret K.

Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film ""Henry V"", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.<br /><br /><i>The Road</i> is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","241","2006-10-02","2006-09-26","0307265439","9780307265432","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600241424l/6288._SY160_.jpg","Alfred A.

Levitt","5397","3.98","732819","16614","255700","280423","143742","33736","19218","Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br />(front flap)","320","2006-10-17","2005-04-12","0061234001","9780061234002","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827l/1202._SX98_.jpg","William Morrow","256612","Freakonomics","eng","[{name=to-read, count=426448}, {name=currently-reading, count=14292}, {name=to-read, count=13455}, {name=non-fiction, count=10667}, {name=economics, count=4667}, {name=nonfiction, count=3986}, {name=business, count=2270}, {name=favorites, count=1558}, {name=science, count=1195}, {name=owned, count=881}, {name=psychology, count=860}, {name=sociology, count=627}, {name=books-i-own, count=464}, {name=audiobook, count=444}, {name=politics, count=384}, {name=finance, count=376}, {name=audiobooks, count=343}, {name=book-club, count=266}, {name=library, count=265}, {name=social-science, count=245}, {name=economy, count=242}, {name=audio, count=238}, {name=kindle, count=237}, {name=default, count=199}, {name=to-buy, count=158}, {name=owned-books, count=148}, {name=behavioral-economics, count=145}, {name=adult, count=145}, {name=culture, count=144}, {name=non-fic, count=137}, {name=philosophy, count=137}, {name=econ, count=136}, {name=my-library, count=134}, {name=society, count=126}, {name=history, count=116}, {name=english, count=115}, {name=business-economics, count=115}, {name=ebook, count=113}, {name=audible, count=112}, {name=statistics, count=109}, {name=self-help, count=108}, {name=abandoned, count=108}, {name=my-books, count=104}, {name=to-read-non-fiction, count=103}, {name=business-books, count=102}, {name=popular-science, count=100}, {name=educational, count=100}, {name=essays, count=100}, {name=other, count=96}, {name=audio-books, count=93}, {name=political, count=90}, {name=to-read-nonfiction, count=89}, {name=audio-book, count=88}, {name=education, count=86}, {name=school, count=85}, {name=nonfic, count=84}, {name=social-sciences, count=83}, {name=social, count=78}, {name=ebooks, count=76}, {name=favourites, count=75}, {name=general, count=72}, {name=unfinished, count=72}, {name=economics-finance, count=70}, {name=money, count=69}, {name=pop-science, count=69}, {name=finance-economics, count=67}, {name=misc, count=66}, {name=american, count=66}, {name=2006, count=66}, {name=economia, count=65}, {name=bookshelf, count=65}, {name=wish-list, count=65}, {name=mathematics, count=64}, {name=borrowed, count=64}, {name=reference, count=64}, {name=non-fiction-to-read, count=63}, {name=interesting, count=63}, {name=100-books-bucket-list, count=61}, {name=self-improvement, count=59}, {name=economics-business, count=58}, {name=economic, count=58}, {name=home-library, count=57}, {name=recommended, count=57}, {name=i-own, count=57}, {name=personal-development, count=55}, {name=general-non-fiction, count=55}, {name=other-non-fiction, count=55}, {name=learning, count=54}, {name=have, count=54}, {name=humor, count=54}, {name=read-non-fiction, count=53}, {name=own-it, count=52}, {name=dnf, count=52}, {name=management, count=52}, {name=finished, count=52}, {name=behavioral, count=51}, {name=maybe, count=51}, {name=fiction, count=51}, {name=read-nonfiction, count=50}, {name=bookclub, count=50}]","1"

And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.<br /><br />Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.<br /><br />When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides.

Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.<br /><br />As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.<br /><br /><i>The Goldfinch</i> combines vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.","771","2013-10-22","2013-09-23","0316055433","9780316055437","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378710146l/17333223._SX98_.jpg","Little, Brown and Company",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=550022}, {name=currently-reading, count=48705}, {name=fiction, count=8440}, {name=favorites, count=6451}, {name=book-club, count=2466}, {name=contemporary, count=1792}, {name=books-i-own, count=1331}, {name=owned, count=1293}, {name=literary-fiction, count=1042}, {name=audiobook, count=891}, {name=kindle, count=882}, {name=audiobooks, count=842}, {name=favourites, count=801}, {name=pulitzer, count=768}, {name=abandoned, count=693}, {name=dnf, count=685}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=671}, {name=art, count=635}, {name=audio, count=622}, {name=did-not-finish, count=592}, {name=adult, count=551}, {name=novels, count=530}, {name=adult-fiction, count=528}, {name=read-in-2014, count=503}, {name=mystery, count=500}, {name=pulitzer-prize, count=465}, {name=library, count=458}, {name=literature, count=433}, {name=to-buy, count=416}, {name=coming-of-age, count=405}, {name=owned-books, count=404}, {name=bookclub, count=377}, {name=audible, count=343}, {name=tbr, count=327}, {name=ebook, count=317}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=298}, {name=audio-books, count=292}, {name=general-fiction, count=285}, {name=new-york, count=270}, {name=read-in-2019, count=268}, {name=unfinished, count=264}, {name=read-in-2015, count=262}, {name=read-2014, count=261}, {name=novel, count=257}, {name=american, count=250}, {name=literary, count=242}, {name=audio-book, count=235}, {name=drama, count=235}, {name=book-club-books, count=203}, {name=pulitzer-prize-winners, count=199}, {name=my-library, count=199}, {name=couldn-t-finish, count=190}, {name=owned-tbr, count=187}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=185}, {name=ebooks, count=180}, {name=my-books, count=179}, {name=classics, count=178}, {name=dark-academia, count=178}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=178}, {name=crime, count=170}, {name=on-hold, count=166}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=166}, {name=to-read-fiction, count=166}, {name=wish-list, count=166}, {name=book-group, count=164}, {name=physical-tbr, count=162}, {name=21st-century, count=158}, {name=pulitzer-winners, count=157}, {name=read-2019, count=155}, {name=gave-up, count=155}, {name=favorite-books, count=153}, {name=read-in-2016, count=150}, {name=2014-books, count=145}, {name=gave-up-on, count=140}, {name=bookshelf, count=139}, {name=recommended, count=139}, {name=i-own, count=138}, {name=read-2015, count=137}, {name=faves, count=137}, {name=female-authors, count=136}, {name=never-finished, count=135}, {name=american-literature, count=135}, {name=read-in-2018, count=134}, {name=read-in-2020, count=133}, {name=english, count=132}, {name=pulitzers, count=129}, {name=thriller, count=127}, {name=stopped-reading, count=126}, {name=art-theft, count=126}, {name=own-it, count=125}, {name=usa, count=122}, {name=5-stars, count=121}, {name=2014-reads, count=119}, {name=female-author, count=119}, {name=e-book, count=119}, {name=2019-reads, count=118}, {name=finished, count=115}, {name=friendship, count=114}, {name=nyc, count=113}, {name=could-not-finish, count=112}]","1"

Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. <br /><br />But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office.

It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits. <br /><br />Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough ... not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work. <br /><br />Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.","321","2010-09-01","2010-08-20",,,"Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554546259l/7937843._SX98_.jpg","Little, Brown and Company",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=373919}, {name=currently-reading, count=9651}, {name=fiction, count=7392}, {name=favorites, count=4580}, {name=book-club, count=2947}, {name=contemporary, count=1927}, {name=books-i-own, count=1651}, {name=owned, count=1250}, {name=adult, count=840}, {name=adult-fiction, count=734}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=630}, {name=kindle, count=626}, {name=favourites, count=586}, {name=audiobook, count=542}, {name=bookclub, count=495}, {name=audiobooks, count=492}, {name=thriller, count=482}, {name=library, count=467}, {name=drama, count=449}, {name=owned-books, count=445}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=425}, {name=crime, count=403}, {name=read-in-2011, count=396}, {name=novels, count=379}, {name=read-in-2016, count=370}, {name=general-fiction, count=365}, {name=literary-fiction, count=361}, {name=audio, count=348}, {name=to-buy, count=289}, {name=book-club-books, count=288}, {name=ebook, count=274}, {name=family, count=271}, {name=mystery, count=256}, {name=abuse, count=251}, {name=suspense, count=242}, {name=survival, count=225}, {name=my-library, count=220}, {name=abduction, count=219}, {name=my-books, count=218}, {name=psychology, count=215}, {name=dnf, count=209}, {name=ebooks, count=206}, {name=canadian, count=200}, {name=audio-books, count=198}, {name=literature, count=196}, {name=novel, count=192}, {name=i-own, count=188}, {name=read-2016, count=184}, {name=abandoned, count=184}, {name=read-in-2015, count=174}, {name=read-in-2012, count=174}, {name=tbr, count=174}, {name=read-2011, count=172}, {name=did-not-finish, count=172}, {name=book-club-reads, count=166}, {name=audio-book, count=165}, {name=book-group, count=155}, {name=borrowed, count=148}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=141}, {name=read-in-2017, count=139}, {name=horror, count=138}, {name=child-narrator, count=135}, {name=mystery-thriller, count=134}, {name=recommended, count=132}, {name=wish-list, count=130}, {name=read-in-2013, count=130}, {name=english, count=130}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=128}, {name=captivity, count=128}, {name=2016-reads, count=120}, {name=5-stars, count=120}, {name=default, count=119}, {name=literary, count=119}, {name=female-authors, count=118}, {name=favorite-books, count=116}, {name=mental-health, count=116}, {name=kidnapping, count=116}, {name=read-in-2014, count=115}, {name=e-book, count=115}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=111}, {name=young-adult, count=111}, {name=own-it, count=110}, {name=psychological, count=110}, {name=modern-fiction, count=108}, {name=audible, count=106}, {name=irish, count=106}, {name=stand-alone, count=105}, {name=female-author, count=105}, {name=bookshelf, count=104}, {name=dark, count=104}, {name=e-books, count=101}, {name=reviewed, count=100}, {name=read-in-2010, count=100}, {name=read-in-2018, count=98}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=93}, {name=maybe, count=93}, {name=have, count=89}, {name=emma-donoghue, count=89}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=88}, {name=finished, count=87}]","1"

Shocked, intrigued, and ultimately repelled by Christian's singular sexual tastes, Ana demanded a deeper commitment; determined to keep her, Christian agreed. Now, together, they have more-love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of infinite possibilities. But Ana always knew that loving her Fifty Shades would not be easy and being together poses challenges neither of them ever anticipated. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian's opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own integrity, identity, or independence; Christian must somehow overcome his compulsion to control and lay to rest the horrors that blighted his past and haunt his present. Just when it seems that together their love can conquer any obstacle, tragedy, malice and fate combine to make Ana's worst nightmares come true.","551","2012-01-19","2012-04-17","1612130607","9781612130606","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320316311l/12881778._SX98_.jpg","The Writer's Coffee Shop Publishing House","63134","Fifty Shades","eng","[{name=to-read, count=129578}, {name=currently-reading, count=15330}, {name=romance, count=5613}, {name=favorites, count=4641}, {name=erotica, count=2014}, {name=fiction, count=1696}, {name=series, count=1277}, {name=bdsm, count=1182}, {name=books-i-own, count=1109}, {name=adult, count=1085}, {name=contemporary, count=849}, {name=owned, count=798}, {name=kindle, count=664}, {name=contemporary-romance, count=617}, {name=chick-lit, count=616}, {name=read-in-2012, count=614}, {name=erotic, count=605}, {name=e-l-james, count=545}, {name=erotic-romance, count=516}, {name=fifty-shades, count=480}, {name=ebook, count=470}, {name=default, count=370}, {name=my-books, count=358}, {name=owned-books, count=333}, {name=read-2012, count=332}, {name=ebooks, count=321}, {name=adult-fiction, count=312}, {name=new-adult, count=298}, {name=alpha-male, count=262}, {name=favorite, count=260}, {name=favourites, count=241}, {name=smut, count=238}, {name=e-book, count=214}, {name=re-read, count=204}, {name=adult-romance, count=202}, {name=finished, count=199}, {name=love, count=199}, {name=5-stars, count=190}, {name=dnf, count=189}, {name=2012-reads, count=187}, {name=steamy, count=183}, {name=el-james, count=180}, {name=50-shades, count=172}, {name=my-library, count=166}, {name=guilty-pleasures, count=161}, {name=fifty-shades-of-grey, count=159}, {name=read-in-2013, count=156}, {name=my-favorites, count=153}, {name=i-own, count=150}, {name=e-books, count=150}, {name=library, count=141}, {name=books, count=139}, {name=nook, count=138}, {name=read-in-2015, count=134}, {name=guilty-pleasure, count=132}, {name=favorite-books, count=126}, {name=drama, count=124}, {name=trilogy, count=118}, {name=kindle-books, count=118}, {name=favs, count=118}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=117}, {name=audiobook, count=114}, {name=sexy, count=114}, {name=book-club, count=113}, {name=read-2013, count=110}, {name=2012-books, count=110}, {name=hot, count=105}, {name=abandoned, count=104}, {name=did-not-finish, count=103}, {name=billionaire, count=102}, {name=done, count=101}, {name=faves, count=101}, {name=loved, count=99}, {name=2012-read, count=98}, {name=dark, count=97}, {name=have, count=93}, {name=novels, count=93}, {name=paperback, count=91}, {name=read-in-2014, count=90}, {name=4-stars, count=90}, {name=audiobooks, count=90}, {name=part-of-a-series, count=89}, {name=bookshelf, count=86}, {name=mine, count=86}, {name=english, count=86}, {name=fantasy, count=85}, {name=romantic, count=85}, {name=books-read-in-2012, count=84}, {name=books-i-have, count=82}, {name=audio, count=82}, {name=romance-erotica, count=81}, {name=not-interested, count=79}, {name=borrowed, count=78}, {name=own-it, count=78}, {name=alpha-males, count=76}, {name=read-in-english, count=74}, {name=loved-it, count=74}, {name=book-boyfriends, count=73}, {name=audible, count=73}, {name=fifty-shades-trilogy, count=72}]","1"

Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable. Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end: dispassionate, clinical, disengaged from his own emotions.

She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.<br /><br />Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gaëtan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.<br /><br />With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. <i>The Nightingale</i> tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.","440","2015-02-03","2015-10-08","0312577222","9780312577223","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598993363l/21853621._SX98_.jpg","St. Martin's Press",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=505843}, {name=currently-reading, count=43342}, {name=historical-fiction, count=10900}, {name=favorites, count=8418}, {name=fiction, count=4724}, {name=book-club, count=3542}, {name=historical, count=1707}, {name=wwii, count=1218}, {name=books-i-own, count=1099}, {name=war, count=969}, {name=audiobook, count=925}, {name=owned, count=894}, {name=audiobooks, count=860}, {name=adult, count=734}, {name=kindle, count=711}, {name=audio, count=629}, {name=favourites, count=569}, {name=france, count=556}, {name=ww2, count=552}, {name=world-war-ii, count=552}, {name=history, count=511}, {name=adult-fiction, count=509}, {name=library, count=507}, {name=romance, count=481}, {name=bookclub, count=450}, {name=read-in-2016, count=425}, {name=to-buy, count=402}, {name=holocaust, count=346}, {name=audible, count=339}, {name=tbr, count=326}, {name=audio-books, count=323}, {name=book-club-books, count=307}, {name=dnf, count=305}, {name=read-in-2015, count=301}, {name=kristin-hannah, count=298}, {name=owned-books, count=286}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=285}, {name=audio-book, count=279}, {name=read-in-2018, count=262}, {name=world-war-2, count=256}, {name=read-in-2019, count=254}, {name=favorite-books, count=254}, {name=read-in-2017, count=247}, {name=novels, count=241}, {name=ebook, count=241}, {name=read-2016, count=233}, {name=did-not-finish, count=226}, {name=5-stars, count=225}, {name=abandoned, count=214}, {name=read-in-2020, count=213}, {name=book-club-reads, count=212}, {name=read-2015, count=190}, {name=2020-reads, count=184}, {name=2019-reads, count=181}, {name=made-me-cry, count=174}, {name=wish-list, count=173}, {name=family, count=170}, {name=drama, count=170}, {name=2020-books, count=166}, {name=book-group, count=165}, {name=favorite, count=164}, {name=recommended, count=163}, {name=my-favorites, count=162}, {name=read-2020, count=160}, {name=europe, count=155}, {name=contemporary, count=153}, {name=my-books, count=151}, {name=my-library, count=149}, {name=owned-tbr, count=149}, {name=read-2019, count=148}, {name=ebooks, count=148}, {name=2016-reads, count=143}, {name=literary-fiction, count=141}, {name=fiction-historical, count=140}, {name=2019-books, count=137}, {name=read-2017, count=137}, {name=physical-tbr, count=136}, {name=2015-books, count=131}, {name=finished, count=131}, {name=2018-reads, count=131}, {name=read-2018, count=130}, {name=2016-books, count=130}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=129}, {name=recommendations, count=125}, {name=faves, count=118}, {name=maybe, count=115}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=111}, {name=sisters, count=109}, {name=women, count=107}, {name=novel, count=107}, {name=2018-books, count=105}, {name=library-book, count=103}, {name=2015-reads, count=103}, {name=listened-to, count=102}, {name=e-book, count=101}, {name=favs, count=101}, {name=2017-books, count=100}, {name=stand-alone, count=99}, {name=general-fiction, count=98}, {name=survival, count=95}]","1"

Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.<br /><br />Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. <br /><br />But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. <br /><br />True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. <br /><br />Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.","391","2011-09-13","2011-09-13","0385534639","9780385534635","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387124618l/9361589._SX98_.jpg","Doubleday",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=602409}, {name=currently-reading, count=28985}, {name=fantasy, count=17788}, {name=favorites, count=14924}, {name=fiction, count=7389}, {name=romance, count=3902}, {name=book-club, count=3378}, {name=books-i-own, count=3041}, {name=historical-fiction, count=2618}, {name=owned, count=2593}, {name=favourites, count=1975}, {name=magic, count=1847}, {name=young-adult, count=1676}, {name=magical-realism, count=1650}, {name=audiobook, count=1399}, {name=adult, count=1395}, {name=dnf, count=1371}, {name=audiobooks, count=1210}, {name=historical, count=998}, {name=library, count=921}, {name=ya, count=866}, {name=owned-books, count=818}, {name=kindle, count=799}, {name=adult-fiction, count=774}, {name=tbr, count=736}, {name=audio, count=731}, {name=to-buy, count=684}, {name=did-not-finish, count=637}, {name=paranormal, count=578}, {name=ｆａｖｏｒｉｔｅｓ, count=569}, {name=circus, count=543}, {name=abandoned, count=541}, {name=bookclub, count=540}, {name=mystery, count=534}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=501}, {name=read-in-2012, count=478}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=478}, {name=ebook, count=412}, {name=stand-alone, count=392}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=390}, {name=novels, count=385}, {name=5-stars, count=354}, {name=my-books, count=351}, {name=audio-books, count=349}, {name=my-library, count=338}, {name=read-in-2015, count=333}, {name=i-own, count=333}, {name=favorite-books, count=321}, {name=read-in-2013, count=313}, {name=contemporary, count=311}, {name=book-club-books, count=310}, {name=audio-book, count=310}, {name=owned-tbr, count=308}, {name=audible, count=306}, {name=supernatural, count=305}, {name=ebooks, count=304}, {name=urban-fantasy, count=303}, {name=read-in-2017, count=297}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=294}, {name=wish-list, count=292}, {name=read-in-2014, count=292}, {name=standalone, count=288}, {name=faves, count=286}, {name=physical-tbr, count=285}, {name=read-in-2019, count=282}, {name=favorite, count=266}, {name=read-in-2016, count=261}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=258}, {name=read-in-2018, count=256}, {name=reviewed, count=255}, {name=recommended, count=253}, {name=read-in-2020, count=243}, {name=magical, count=240}, {name=unfinished, count=239}, {name=re-read, count=231}, {name=maybe, count=229}, {name=2020-reads, count=225}, {name=bookshelf, count=223}, {name=on-hold, count=221}, {name=literary-fiction, count=221}, {name=general-fiction, count=209}, {name=historical-fantasy, count=203}, {name=love, count=202}, {name=ya-fantasy, count=200}, {name=adventure, count=197}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=196}, {name=adult-fantasy, count=195}, {name=own-it, count=194}, {name=read-2012, count=192}, {name=stand-alones, count=190}, {name=book-club-reads, count=185}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=183}, {name=magic-realism, count=179}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=177}, {name=read-in-2011, count=177}, {name=novel, count=175}, {name=my-favorites, count=173}, {name=library-books, count=173}, {name=want-to-buy, count=173}, {name=cover-love, count=170}]","1"

Certainly the last person he thought he'd fall for was Jamie, the shy, almost ethereal daughter of the town's Baptist minister....Jamie, who was destined to show him the depths of the human heart-and the joy and pain of living.

In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.<br /><br />Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch.

Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes <i>A Game of Thrones</i> and <i>A Clash of Kings</i>. Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.<br /><br />Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall. Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords...","1177","2003-03-04","2000-08-08","055357342X","9780553573428","Mass Market Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571318786l/62291._SX98_.jpg","Bantam","43790","A Song of Ice and Fire","eng","[{name=to-read, count=179483}, {name=fantasy, count=26805}, {name=currently-reading, count=21682}, {name=favorites, count=10173}, {name=fiction, count=5601}, {name=owned, count=2751}, {name=books-i-own, count=2001}, {name=series, count=1571}, {name=epic-fantasy, count=1212}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=947}, {name=favourites, count=892}, {name=kindle, count=861}, {name=a-song-of-ice-and-fire, count=824}, {name=high-fantasy, count=809}, {name=game-of-thrones, count=687}, {name=adult, count=686}, {name=owned-books, count=639}, {name=audiobook, count=611}, {name=adventure, count=604}, {name=dragons, count=581}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=569}, {name=audiobooks, count=529}, {name=george-r-r-martin, count=528}, {name=epic, count=508}, {name=default, count=483}, {name=ebook, count=427}, {name=novels, count=401}, {name=my-books, count=377}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=365}, {name=library, count=351}, {name=my-library, count=335}, {name=ebooks, count=295}, {name=magic, count=291}, {name=audible, count=287}, {name=audio, count=286}, {name=5-stars, count=285}, {name=war, count=276}, {name=books, count=266}, {name=read-in-2012, count=261}, {name=adult-fiction, count=261}, {name=science-fiction-fantasy, count=260}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=257}, {name=english, count=246}, {name=fantasia, count=242}, {name=re-read, count=238}, {name=science-fiction, count=236}, {name=asoiaf, count=234}, {name=read-in-2013, count=226}, {name=fantasy-scifi, count=219}, {name=read-in-2014, count=215}, {name=to-buy, count=210}, {name=i-own, count=207}, {name=song-of-ice-and-fire, count=206}, {name=novel, count=200}, {name=sci-fi, count=195}, {name=tbr, count=187}, {name=favorite-books, count=181}, {name=george-rr-martin, count=175}, {name=fiction-fantasy, count=172}, {name=medieval, count=171}, {name=audio-books, count=167}, {name=favorite, count=166}, {name=bookshelf, count=161}, {name=fantasía, count=156}, {name=read-in-2011, count=155}, {name=e-book, count=151}, {name=sci-fi-and-fantasy, count=150}, {name=fantasy-fiction, count=148}, {name=historical-fiction, count=146}, {name=got, count=143}, {name=own-it, count=141}, {name=adult-fantasy, count=141}, {name=have, count=139}, {name=american, count=138}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=137}, {name=read-2013, count=130}, {name=favoritos, count=128}, {name=read-in-2015, count=127}, {name=historical, count=127}, {name=audio-book, count=125}, {name=read-in-english, count=124}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=124}, {name=dark-fantasy, count=122}, {name=action, count=121}, {name=on-hold, count=121}, {name=e-books, count=121}, {name=genre-fantasy, count=116}, {name=reread, count=115}, {name=owned-tbr, count=113}, {name=read-2012, count=113}, {name=abandoned, count=112}, {name=sff, count=110}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=110}, {name=home-library, count=109}, {name=faves, count=109}, {name=drama, count=105}, {name=5-star, count=103}, {name=paperback, count=102}, {name=read-in-2016, count=100}, {name=personal-library, count=100}]","1"

But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br /><br />Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.<br /><br /><i>For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Alternate Cover Edition</a></i><br />","976","2002-02-04","1989-10-01",,,"Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043._SX98_.jpg","NAL Trade","60161","Kingsbridge","eng","[{name=to-read, count=347648}, {name=currently-reading, count=24230}, {name=historical-fiction, count=10235}, {name=favorites, count=5836}, {name=fiction, count=5738}, {name=historical, count=1867}, {name=owned, count=1266}, {name=books-i-own, count=944}, {name=history, count=911}, {name=series, count=645}, {name=classics, count=523}, {name=fantasy, count=521}, {name=book-club, count=502}, {name=medieval, count=479}, {name=audiobook, count=465}, {name=favourites, count=447}, {name=kindle, count=442}, {name=default, count=441}, {name=ken-follett, count=415}, {name=abandoned, count=360}, {name=audiobooks, count=358}, {name=england, count=344}, {name=novels, count=336}, {name=owned-books, count=335}, {name=adult, count=312}, {name=library, count=305}, {name=audio, count=270}, {name=did-not-finish, count=245}, {name=my-library, count=238}, {name=romance, count=236}, {name=audible, count=236}, {name=dnf, count=235}, {name=novel, count=223}, {name=adult-fiction, count=223}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=222}, {name=epic, count=221}, {name=literature, count=221}, {name=great-american-read, count=219}, {name=ebook, count=205}, {name=to-buy, count=204}, {name=general-fiction, count=193}, {name=fiction-historical, count=191}, {name=my-books, count=185}, {name=architecture, count=171}, {name=favorite-books, count=162}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=159}, {name=drama, count=156}, {name=historic-fiction, count=152}, {name=religion, count=150}, {name=i-own, count=140}, {name=british, count=136}, {name=bookclub, count=135}, {name=unfinished, count=133}, {name=english, count=132}, {name=tbr, count=131}, {name=oprah-s-book-club, count=125}, {name=favorite, count=124}, {name=ebooks, count=124}, {name=middle-ages, count=122}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=120}, {name=audio-books, count=118}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=115}, {name=classic, count=113}, {name=audio-book, count=111}, {name=finished, count=109}, {name=contemporary, count=109}, {name=to-read-fiction, count=108}, {name=oprah, count=108}, {name=adventure, count=106}, {name=my-favorites, count=104}, {name=12th-century, count=103}, {name=wish-list, count=101}, {name=cathedrals, count=101}, {name=historical-novels, count=100}, {name=own-it, count=100}, {name=europe, count=99}, {name=recommended, count=98}, {name=couldn-t-finish, count=97}, {name=follett, count=94}, {name=historical-novel, count=92}, {name=home-library, count=91}, {name=ken-follet, count=90}, {name=thriller, count=88}, {name=5-stars, count=84}, {name=historic, count=84}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=83}, {name=maybe, count=83}, {name=uk, count=82}, {name=own-to-read, count=82}, {name=literary-fiction, count=82}, {name=favoritos, count=80}, {name=have, count=78}, {name=on-hold, count=77}, {name=novela-histórica, count=76}, {name=fiction-to-read, count=76}, {name=bbc-big-read, count=74}, {name=mystery, count=72}, {name=re-read, count=71}, {name=borrowed, count=69}, {name=paperback, count=69}]","1"

The only trouble is that she can't actually afford it–not any of it.<br /><br />Her job writing at Successful Savings not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. And lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from the bank –letters with large red sums she can't bear to read–and they're getting ever harder to ignore.<br /><br />She tries cutting back. But none of her efforts succeeds. Becky's only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something....<br /><br />Finally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life–and the lives of those around her–forever.","368","2003-11-04","2000-01-01","0440241413","9780440241416","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546503932l/9416._SX98_.jpg","Dell Publishing Company","45600","Shopaholic","eng","[{name=to-read, count=179308}, {name=chick-lit, count=4879}, {name=currently-reading, count=2969}, {name=fiction, count=2272}, {name=romance, count=1582}, {name=favorites, count=1222}, {name=contemporary, count=801}, {name=books-i-own, count=798}, {name=chicklit, count=671}, {name=series, count=628}, {name=humor, count=588}, {name=owned, count=556}, {name=sophie-kinsella, count=483}, {name=adult, count=364}, {name=chic-lit, count=363}, {name=funny, count=269}, {name=adult-fiction, count=245}, {name=owned-books, count=215}, {name=contemporary-romance, count=213}, {name=comedy, count=197}, {name=humour, count=185}, {name=young-adult, count=146}, {name=library, count=145}, {name=my-books, count=130}, {name=favourites, count=129}, {name=kindle, count=128}, {name=british, count=126}, {name=novels, count=124}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=122}, {name=guilty-pleasures, count=117}, {name=fluff, count=116}, {name=default, count=113}, {name=beach-reads, count=109}, {name=ebook, count=107}, {name=general-fiction, count=106}, {name=shopaholic, count=104}, {name=i-own, count=97}, {name=audiobook, count=96}, {name=dnf, count=92}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=86}, {name=audiobooks, count=83}, {name=romantic-comedy, count=83}, {name=book-club, count=82}, {name=my-library, count=80}, {name=to-buy, count=79}, {name=fun, count=77}, {name=womens-fiction, count=75}, {name=english, count=75}, {name=did-not-finish, count=74}, {name=ebooks, count=73}, {name=england, count=71}, {name=borrowed, count=71}, {name=novel, count=68}, {name=movie, count=65}, {name=girly, count=65}, {name=shopaholic-series, count=63}, {name=abandoned, count=63}, {name=read-in-2009, count=61}, {name=none, count=60}, {name=own-it, count=58}, {name=guilty-pleasure, count=57}, {name=movies, count=57}, {name=read-in-2015, count=55}, {name=light-reading, count=55}, {name=audio, count=53}, {name=4-stars, count=52}, {name=tbr, count=52}, {name=just-for-fun, count=52}, {name=women-s-fiction, count=51}, {name=paperback, count=50}, {name=finished, count=50}, {name=chick, count=48}, {name=rom-com, count=47}, {name=light-reads, count=47}, {name=kinsella, count=47}, {name=fashion, count=46}, {name=ya, count=45}, {name=re-read, count=45}, {name=3-stars, count=43}, {name=books, count=43}, {name=favorite, count=43}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=42}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=42}, {name=brit-lit, count=41}, {name=have, count=41}, {name=favorite-books, count=40}, {name=girly-books, count=40}, {name=e-book, count=39}, {name=read-in-2014, count=38}, {name=first-in-series, count=38}, {name=hilarious, count=38}, {name=5-stars, count=38}, {name=london, count=38}, {name=read-in-2012, count=37}, {name=book-to-movie, count=37}, {name=modern, count=37}, {name=read-2009, count=37}, {name=read-in-2010, count=36}, {name=read-in-english, count=36}, {name=read-in-2017, count=34}]","1"

When he commits an act of murder and theft, he sets into motion a story that, for its excruciating suspense, its atmospheric vividness, and its depth of characterization and vision is almost unequaled in the literatures of the world. The best known of Dostoevsky’s masterpieces, Crime and Punishment can bear any amount of rereading without losing a drop of its power over our imaginations. Dostoevsky’s drama of sin, guilt, and redemption transforms the sordid story of an old woman’s murder into the nineteenth century’s profoundest and most compelling philosophical novel. Award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky render this elusive and wildly innovative novel with an energy, suppleness, and range of voice that do full justice to the genius of its creator.","564","1998-01-03","1866-01-01",,,"Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435658196l/5692._SX98_.jpg","Vintage Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=568013}, {name=currently-reading, count=56579}, {name=classics, count=17140}, {name=favorites, count=8996}, {name=fiction, count=8661}, {name=classic, count=2610}, {name=russian, count=2295}, {name=owned, count=2262}, {name=literature, count=1916}, {name=russian-literature, count=1710}, {name=books-i-own, count=1428}, {name=russia, count=1412}, {name=novels, count=1073}, {name=philosophy, count=1027}, {name=favourites, count=842}, {name=crime, count=784}, {name=russian-lit, count=770}, {name=19th-century, count=627}, {name=owned-books, count=551}, {name=kindle, count=550}, {name=novel, count=545}, {name=school, count=507}, {name=classic-literature, count=498}, {name=classics-to-read, count=487}, {name=to-buy, count=466}, {name=library, count=454}, {name=historical-fiction, count=427}, {name=1001-books, count=401}, {name=my-library, count=392}, {name=default, count=346}, {name=mystery, count=328}, {name=psychology, count=326}, {name=literary-fiction, count=316}, {name=my-books, count=299}, {name=audiobook, count=293}, {name=translated, count=273}, {name=my-ebooks, count=263}, {name=high-school, count=263}, {name=abandoned, count=252}, {name=1001, count=251}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=248}, {name=classic-fiction, count=239}, {name=classici, count=230}, {name=to-read-classics, count=230}, {name=dnf, count=229}, {name=audiobooks, count=223}, {name=clàssics, count=217}, {name=unfinished, count=216}, {name=ebook, count=215}, {name=read-for-school, count=211}, {name=re-read, count=210}, {name=russian-classics, count=210}, {name=great-american-read, count=207}, {name=historical, count=206}, {name=drama, count=205}, {name=adult, count=205}, {name=must-read, count=202}, {name=tbr, count=200}, {name=books, count=199}, {name=on-hold, count=196}, {name=favorite, count=192}, {name=dostoyevsky, count=190}, {name=ebooks, count=188}, {name=for-school, count=187}, {name=to-re-read, count=186}, {name=existentialism, count=183}, {name=classic-lit, count=177}, {name=literary, count=176}, {name=did-not-finish, count=174}, {name=favorite-books, count=171}, {name=bookshelf, count=169}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=165}, {name=home-library, count=165}, {name=i-own, count=163}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=159}, {name=audible, count=156}, {name=to-reread, count=156}, {name=classics-tbr, count=155}, {name=book-club, count=150}, {name=lit, count=149}, {name=wish-list, count=147}, {name=general-fiction, count=147}, {name=audio, count=144}, {name=psychological, count=143}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=142}, {name=clásicos, count=139}, {name=tbr-classics, count=134}, {name=favourite, count=132}, {name=school-books, count=130}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=129}, {name=translation, count=128}, {name=to-read-fiction, count=128}, {name=adult-fiction, count=127}, {name=dostoevsky, count=126}, {name=fyodor-dostoyevsky, count=123}, {name=klassiker, count=122}, {name=5-stars, count=118}, {name=have, count=116}, {name=own-it, count=114}, {name=the-classics, count=112}]","1"

When Griet becomes a maid in the household of the painter Johannes Vermeer, she thinks she knows her role: housework, laundry, and the care of his six children. She even feels able to handle his shrewd mother-in-law; his restless, sensual wife; and their jealous servant. What no one expects is that Griet's quiet manner, quick perceptions, and fascination with her master's paintings will draw her inexorably into his world. Their growing intimacy sparks whispers; and when Vermeer paints her wearing his wife's pearl earrings, the gossip escalates into a full-blown scandal that irrevocably changes Griet's life.<br /><br />Written with the precision and focus of an Old Master painting, <b>Girl With a Pearl Earring</b> is a vivid portrait of colorful seventeenth-century Delft, as well as the hauntingly poignant story of one young girl's rite of passage.","233","2003-09-30","1999-01-01","0452284937","9780452284937","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309202486l/2864._SX98_.jpg","Plume Books",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=276821}, {name=to-read, count=9809}, {name=historical-fiction, count=6267}, {name=fiction, count=3638}, {name=currently-reading, count=2712}, {name=favorites, count=1879}, {name=historical, count=1111}, {name=classics, count=932}, {name=art, count=881}, {name=books-i-own, count=653}, {name=book-club, count=559}, {name=owned, count=540}, {name=romance, count=500}, {name=history, count=322}, {name=adult-fiction, count=269}, {name=adult, count=262}, {name=novels, count=244}, {name=owned-books, count=207}, {name=literature, count=206}, {name=favourites, count=184}, {name=novel, count=167}, {name=library, count=160}, {name=classic, count=159}, {name=netherlands, count=151}, {name=bookclub, count=147}, {name=general-fiction, count=134}, {name=literary-fiction, count=133}, {name=default, count=132}, {name=europe, count=132}, {name=contemporary, count=127}, {name=my-library, count=118}, {name=my-books, count=111}, {name=fiction-historical, count=109}, {name=audiobook, count=109}, {name=art-history, count=108}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=107}, {name=drama, count=99}, {name=young-adult, count=98}, {name=audiobooks, count=98}, {name=17th-century, count=92}, {name=to-buy, count=89}, {name=historic-fiction, count=87}, {name=book-group, count=84}, {name=book-club-books, count=82}, {name=kindle, count=79}, {name=american, count=77}, {name=tracy-chevalier, count=76}, {name=historical-romance, count=70}, {name=audio, count=68}, {name=20th-century, count=66}, {name=i-own, count=65}, {name=own-it, count=62}, {name=art-fiction, count=62}, {name=english, count=60}, {name=school, count=59}, {name=women, count=59}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=56}, {name=coming-of-age, count=56}, {name=finished, count=56}, {name=borrowed, count=55}, {name=historicalfiction, count=55}, {name=ebook, count=54}, {name=female-authors, count=54}, {name=favorite-books, count=53}, {name=movie, count=53}, {name=female-author, count=52}, {name=literary, count=52}, {name=favorite, count=52}, {name=historical-novels, count=51}, {name=chick-lit, count=51}, {name=movies, count=50}, {name=american-literature, count=49}, {name=2004, count=48}, {name=historical-novel, count=46}, {name=historical-fic, count=46}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=45}, {name=holland, count=45}, {name=re-read, count=43}, {name=wish-list, count=42}, {name=bookshelf, count=41}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=40}, {name=home-library, count=40}, {name=high-school, count=40}, {name=tbr, count=39}, {name=audio-book, count=39}, {name=2006, count=39}, {name=usa, count=38}, {name=books, count=38}, {name=book-club-reads, count=36}, {name=read-in-2011, count=35}, {name=recommended, count=35}, {name=vermeer, count=35}, {name=personal-library, count=34}, {name=dutch, count=34}, {name=my-favorites, count=34}, {name=women-authors, count=33}, {name=read-in-2018, count=32}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=31}, {name=ya, count=31}, {name=audio-books, count=31}]","1"

You must never wash the Pants.<br /><br />2. You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky.<br /><br />3. You must never say the word ""phat"" while wearing the Pants. You must also never think ""I am fat"" while wearing the Pants.<br /><br />4. You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence).<br /><br />5. You must not pick your nose while wearing the Pants. You may, however, scratch casually at your nostril while really kind of picking.<br /><br />6. Upon our reunion, you must follow the proper procedures for documenting your time in the Pants.<br /><br />7. You must write to your Sisters throughout the summer, no matter how much fun you are having without them.<br /><br />8.

I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.”<br /><br />January, 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, Dawsey Adams, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name in a book?<br /><br />As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of Dawsey and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i>—a book club born as a spur-of-the- moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts an outstanding cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.<br /><br />Juliet begins a remarkable conversation in letters with the Society’s members, learning about their lives, their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on all of them. Over time, and despite a demanding and dramatic life in London, she finds herself drawn to the self-contained Dawsey Adams, and to the story of Elizabeth, a young woman whose bright spirit and strength live on in the daughter she left behind when she was sent to a concentration camp. Juliet knows she has found the subject of her book, and possibly much more, and sets sail for Guernsey, changing the course of her life forever.<br /><br />A celebration of the written word in all its guises, <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i> is the debut novel by the aunt-and-niece team of Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows.","277","2008-07-29","2008-07-29","0385340990","9780385340991","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351979318l/2728527._SX98_.jpg","The Dial Press",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=286380}, {name=currently-reading, count=13666}, {name=historical-fiction, count=8571}, {name=fiction, count=6188}, {name=favorites, count=5757}, {name=book-club, count=4230}, {name=historical, count=1613}, {name=romance, count=1414}, {name=books-i-own, count=949}, {name=wwii, count=940}, {name=bookclub, count=747}, {name=owned, count=724}, {name=war, count=683}, {name=epistolary, count=674}, {name=audiobook, count=640}, {name=adult, count=640}, {name=adult-fiction, count=638}, {name=books-about-books, count=625}, {name=favourites, count=607}, {name=audiobooks, count=562}, {name=history, count=488}, {name=world-war-ii, count=484}, {name=audio, count=440}, {name=kindle, count=438}, {name=library, count=434}, {name=book-club-books, count=418}, {name=england, count=384}, {name=ww2, count=380}, {name=novels, count=325}, {name=book-group, count=324}, {name=read-in-2018, count=320}, {name=contemporary, count=259}, {name=general-fiction, count=255}, {name=chick-lit, count=253}, {name=owned-books, count=246}, {name=book-club-reads, count=237}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=233}, {name=audio-books, count=228}, {name=letters, count=224}, {name=british, count=214}, {name=literary-fiction, count=211}, {name=world-war-2, count=205}, {name=abandoned, count=201}, {name=ebook, count=199}, {name=to-buy, count=184}, {name=favorite-books, count=183}, {name=dnf, count=179}, {name=literature, count=178}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=175}, {name=novel, count=173}, {name=read-2018, count=172}, {name=did-not-finish, count=172}, {name=humor, count=172}, {name=friendship, count=168}, {name=read-in-2019, count=163}, {name=read-in-2009, count=163}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=161}, {name=audio-book, count=154}, {name=my-library, count=153}, {name=re-read, count=151}, {name=favorite, count=151}, {name=5-stars, count=151}, {name=my-books, count=150}, {name=my-favorites, count=143}, {name=recommended, count=137}, {name=europe, count=134}, {name=read-in-2010, count=133}, {name=fiction-historical, count=133}, {name=channel-islands, count=130}, {name=2018-reads, count=129}, {name=drama, count=128}, {name=german-occupation, count=120}, {name=audible, count=120}, {name=ebooks, count=117}, {name=2018-books, count=114}, {name=holocaust, count=112}, {name=i-own, count=110}, {name=guernsey, count=107}, {name=read-in-2020, count=105}, {name=wish-list, count=101}, {name=english, count=100}, {name=read-2019, count=99}, {name=own-it, count=99}, {name=default, count=97}, {name=read-in-2017, count=96}, {name=faves, count=96}, {name=borrowed, count=94}, {name=library-books, count=93}, {name=tbr, count=92}, {name=historical-romance, count=91}, {name=read-in-2013, count=90}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=89}, {name=uk, count=88}, {name=read-in-2011, count=87}, {name=home-library, count=87}, {name=read-in-2012, count=86}, {name=historic-fiction, count=86}, {name=recommend, count=84}, {name=finished, count=80}, {name=2019-reads, count=79}]","1"

Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.<br /><br />Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.<br /><br />Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim?

This sound signals the true beginning of his life -- the beginning of suffering, rejection, peace, and, finally, wisdom.","224","2002-01-22","1922-01-01","1400001293","9781400001293","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368251757l/6111._SX98_.jpg","Plaza y Janes",,,,"[{name=to-read, count=319054}, {name=currently-reading, count=21873}, {name=classics, count=6843}, {name=fiction, count=6761}, {name=favorites, count=5256}, {name=philosophy, count=3702}, {name=spirituality, count=1298}, {name=religion, count=1276}, {name=owned, count=1211}, {name=literature, count=1150}, {name=classic, count=1015}, {name=buddhism, count=761}, {name=books-i-own, count=714}, {name=german, count=707}, {name=spiritual, count=695}, {name=novels, count=635}, {name=historical-fiction, count=611}, {name=india, count=426}, {name=school, count=424}, {name=favourites, count=400}, {name=german-literature, count=370}, {name=novel, count=365}, {name=owned-books, count=313}, {name=1001-books, count=309}, {name=kindle, count=301}, {name=library, count=284}, {name=non-fiction, count=237}, {name=germany, count=234}, {name=default, count=231}, {name=to-buy, count=227}, {name=20th-century, count=225}, {name=1001, count=224}, {name=my-library, count=222}, {name=great-american-read, count=219}, {name=read-for-school, count=193}, {name=high-school, count=192}, {name=literary-fiction, count=190}, {name=classic-literature, count=187}, {name=historical, count=186}, {name=my-ebooks, count=181}, {name=audiobook, count=176}, {name=ebook, count=175}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=169}, {name=history, count=164}, {name=nobel, count=163}, {name=book-club, count=161}, {name=re-read, count=161}, {name=my-books, count=159}, {name=classici, count=158}, {name=audiobooks, count=153}, {name=adult, count=150}, {name=for-school, count=146}, {name=philosophical, count=145}, {name=asia, count=144}, {name=hermann-hesse, count=141}, {name=self-help, count=141}, {name=translated, count=140}, {name=german-lit, count=140}, {name=to-re-read, count=129}, {name=religion-spirituality, count=127}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=126}, {name=deutsch, count=122}, {name=nobel-prize, count=122}, {name=books, count=120}, {name=school-books, count=120}, {name=modern-classics, count=116}, {name=biography, count=116}, {name=general-fiction, count=115}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=114}, {name=adult-fiction, count=114}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=114}, {name=ebooks, count=111}, {name=must-read, count=110}, {name=favorite, count=109}, {name=religious, count=107}, {name=classics-to-read, count=105}, {name=inspirational, count=105}, {name=literary, count=103}, {name=favorite-books, count=101}, {name=to-reread, count=98}, {name=abandoned, count=95}, {name=read-again, count=95}, {name=audio, count=93}, {name=rory-gilmore, count=90}, {name=narrativa, count=90}, {name=psychology, count=87}, {name=bookshelf, count=86}, {name=home-library, count=86}, {name=hesse, count=86}, {name=1920s, count=85}, {name=klassiker, count=84}, {name=classic-fiction, count=84}, {name=translation, count=83}, {name=i-own, count=82}, {name=reread, count=82}, {name=mythology, count=78}, {name=clàssics, count=77}, {name=classic-lit, count=77}, {name=lit, count=77}, {name=fictión, count=76}]","1"

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts. <br /><br />With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.","288","2006-09-21","1989-01-01","0143038095","9780143038092","Paperback","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586662847l/7763._SX98_.jpg","Penguin Group",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=187958}, {name=fiction, count=5999}, {name=currently-reading, count=4846}, {name=favorites, count=2399}, {name=historical-fiction, count=1623}, {name=classics, count=1465}, {name=china, count=649}, {name=owned, count=622}, {name=contemporary, count=620}, {name=books-i-own, count=589}, {name=book-club, count=396}, {name=adult-fiction, count=388}, {name=adult, count=362}, {name=literature, count=348}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=339}, {name=novels, count=335}, {name=asia, count=325}, {name=historical, count=318}, {name=school, count=298}, {name=general-fiction, count=288}, {name=asian, count=278}, {name=literary-fiction, count=267}, {name=chick-lit, count=260}, {name=classic, count=257}, {name=great-american-read, count=245}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-challenge, count=212}, {name=library, count=191}, {name=high-school, count=188}, {name=women, count=188}, {name=family, count=186}, {name=cultural, count=181}, {name=novel, count=179}, {name=asian-american, count=176}, {name=drama, count=155}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=153}, {name=owned-books, count=152}, {name=kindle, count=149}, {name=chinese, count=149}, {name=read-for-school, count=144}, {name=american, count=137}, {name=the-great-american-read, count=127}, {name=amy-tan, count=126}, {name=to-buy, count=121}, {name=favourites, count=116}, {name=my-library, count=112}, {name=audiobooks, count=110}, {name=audiobook, count=110}, {name=literary, count=104}, {name=rory-gilmore-challenge, count=101}, {name=feminism, count=100}, {name=female-authors, count=98}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=97}, {name=for-school, count=97}, {name=default, count=95}, {name=modern-fiction, count=94}, {name=20th-century, count=93}, {name=re-read, count=93}, {name=school-books, count=92}, {name=asian-lit, count=89}, {name=gilmore-girls, count=89}, {name=history, count=88}, {name=my-books, count=83}, {name=favorite-books, count=82}, {name=rory-gilmore, count=82}, {name=asian-literature, count=81}, {name=own-it, count=77}, {name=rory-gilmore-reading-list, count=76}, {name=california, count=74}, {name=i-own, count=74}, {name=american-literature, count=73}, {name=pbs-great-american-read, count=70}, {name=modern-classics, count=70}, {name=coming-of-age, count=70}, {name=multicultural, count=69}, {name=audio, count=67}, {name=culture, count=64}, {name=female-author, count=64}, {name=bookclub, count=64}, {name=immigration, count=63}, {name=asian-authors, count=62}, {name=wish-list, count=60}, {name=women-authors, count=60}, {name=ebook, count=59}, {name=fiction-general, count=57}, {name=young-adult, count=57}, {name=american-lit, count=57}, {name=to-read-fiction, count=56}, {name=poc, count=54}, {name=women-writers, count=54}, {name=ebooks, count=53}, {name=authors-of-color, count=52}, {name=usa, count=52}, {name=america, count=50}, {name=school-reading, count=50}, {name=favorite, count=49}, {name=home-library, count=49}, {name=immigrant-experience, count=49}, {name=tbr, count=48}, {name=did-not-finish, count=48}, {name=short-stories, count=48}]","1"

To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House calls upon the skills of intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic scholar Michael Tolland, Rachel travels to the Arctic and uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery—a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. But before she can warn the president, Rachel and Michael are ambushed by a team of assassins. Fleeing for their lives across a desolate and lethal landscape, their only hope for survival is to discover who is behind this masterful plot.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.<p>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.</p><p>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.</p><p>Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.</p><p>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?</p><p>Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.</p>","370","2010-02-02","2010-02-02","1400052173","9781400052172","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878144l/6493208._SX98_.jpg","Crown Publishing Group",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=479006}, {name=currently-reading, count=15882}, {name=non-fiction, count=10812}, {name=nonfiction, count=5515}, {name=science, count=4678}, {name=book-club, count=3815}, {name=history, count=2981}, {name=biography, count=2950}, {name=favorites, count=2577}, {name=audiobook, count=806}, {name=medicine, count=791}, {name=audiobooks, count=728}, {name=books-i-own, count=664}, {name=owned, count=646}, {name=bookclub, count=619}, {name=medical, count=611}, {name=audio, count=533}, {name=kindle, count=530}, {name=biography-memoir, count=434}, {name=historical, count=433}, {name=biographies, count=422}, {name=library, count=415}, {name=race, count=365}, {name=african-american, count=356}, {name=adult, count=353}, {name=book-club-books, count=332}, {name=health, count=322}, {name=memoir, count=311}, {name=biology, count=295}, {name=book-group, count=279}, {name=ebook, count=234}, {name=audio-books, count=217}, {name=to-buy, count=210}, {name=school, count=203}, {name=bioethics, count=194}, {name=cancer, count=193}, {name=abandoned, count=192}, {name=book-club-reads, count=191}, {name=memoir-biography, count=186}, {name=social-justice, count=176}, {name=audio-book, count=175}, {name=did-not-finish, count=173}, {name=read-in-2011, count=171}, {name=owned-books, count=168}, {name=women, count=165}, {name=non-fic, count=161}, {name=fiction, count=160}, {name=audible, count=156}, {name=ethics, count=154}, {name=american-history, count=147}, {name=memoirs, count=136}, {name=read-in-2012, count=135}, {name=didn-t-finish, count=131}, {name=read-in-2017, count=125}, {name=favourites, count=125}, {name=to-read-non-fiction, count=124}, {name=my-library, count=119}, {name=public-health, count=119}, {name=my-books, count=117}, {name=ebooks, count=117}, {name=adult-non-fiction, count=111}, {name=dnf, count=110}, {name=american, count=109}, {name=bio, count=105}, {name=to-read-nonfiction, count=104}, {name=read-2011, count=101}, {name=historical-fiction, count=101}, {name=read-in-2013, count=101}, {name=adult-nonfiction, count=99}, {name=read-in-2018, count=97}, {name=non-fiction-to-read, count=97}, {name=read-in-2015, count=96}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=96}, {name=recommended, count=95}, {name=nonfic, count=95}, {name=e-book, count=94}, {name=female-authors, count=94}, {name=bio-memoir, count=93}, {name=female-author, count=92}, {name=feminism, count=92}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=92}, {name=unfinished, count=92}, {name=family, count=89}, {name=biographical, count=89}, {name=popular-science, count=89}, {name=wish-list, count=86}, {name=racism, count=86}, {name=contemporary, count=85}, {name=read-2017, count=84}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=84}, {name=sociology, count=83}, {name=social-issues, count=83}, {name=borrowed, count=81}, {name=default, count=80}, {name=own-it, count=80}, {name=read-in-2016, count=79}, {name=library-book, count=78}, {name=read-for-school, count=77}, {name=genetics, count=76}, {name=book-club-selections, count=74}]","1"

To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret, and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction.

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. <br /> <br />In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.","599","2018-11-13","2018-11-13",,,"ebook","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527182226l/38744839._SX98_.jpg","Crown",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=545355}, {name=currently-reading, count=107281}, {name=non-fiction, count=8059}, {name=memoir, count=4609}, {name=favorites, count=4030}, {name=nonfiction, count=3681}, {name=biography, count=3281}, {name=audiobook, count=2892}, {name=audiobooks, count=2773}, {name=book-club, count=1607}, {name=memoirs, count=1539}, {name=audio, count=1345}, {name=autobiography, count=1218}, {name=politics, count=1188}, {name=read-in-2019, count=1172}, {name=biographies, count=883}, {name=audible, count=837}, {name=books-i-own, count=785}, {name=biography-memoir, count=773}, {name=read-2019, count=771}, {name=owned, count=752}, {name=audio-books, count=704}, {name=2019-reads, count=657}, {name=2019-books, count=638}, {name=audio-book, count=587}, {name=feminism, count=539}, {name=library, count=488}, {name=read-in-2020, count=474}, {name=adult, count=459}, {name=memoir-biography, count=443}, {name=history, count=439}, {name=favourites, count=388}, {name=2019-read, count=331}, {name=2020-reads, count=330}, {name=read-2020, count=308}, {name=kindle, count=294}, {name=2020-books, count=289}, {name=women, count=274}, {name=dnf, count=263}, {name=african-american, count=259}, {name=to-buy, count=251}, {name=read-in-2018, count=239}, {name=bookclub, count=236}, {name=2019-reading-challenge, count=227}, {name=did-not-finish, count=224}, {name=political, count=213}, {name=tbr, count=206}, {name=race, count=201}, {name=biographies-memoirs, count=200}, {name=abandoned, count=199}, {name=5-stars, count=193}, {name=autobiography-memoir, count=193}, {name=ebook, count=193}, {name=listened-to, count=188}, {name=bio, count=187}, {name=black-authors, count=179}, {name=owned-books, count=178}, {name=auto-biography, count=171}, {name=2019-reading-list, count=164}, {name=2019-books-read, count=162}, {name=biography-autobiography, count=159}, {name=inspirational, count=158}, {name=contemporary, count=158}, {name=autobiographies, count=156}, {name=listened, count=152}, {name=feminist, count=150}, {name=bio-memoir, count=148}, {name=english, count=147}, {name=books-read-in-2019, count=144}, {name=2020-read, count=136}, {name=american, count=134}, {name=my-library, count=133}, {name=family, count=132}, {name=memoirs-biographies, count=132}, {name=on-hold, count=131}, {name=bios, count=127}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=126}, {name=my-books, count=121}, {name=memoir-autobiography, count=120}, {name=female-authors, count=120}, {name=2020-reading-challenge, count=119}, {name=female-author, count=119}, {name=book-club-books, count=117}, {name=2019-challenge, count=116}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=116}, {name=2018-reads, count=114}, {name=biographical, count=113}, {name=wish-list, count=113}, {name=2018-releases, count=113}, {name=usa, count=112}, {name=2020-reading-list, count=112}, {name=2018-books, count=112}, {name=read-2018, count=111}, {name=poc, count=111}, {name=non-fic, count=110}, {name=biographies-and-memoirs, count=104}, {name=borrowed, count=103}, {name=authors-of-color, count=103}, {name=ebooks, count=102}, {name=unfinished, count=100}]","1"

With a text fully corrected under the supervision of Christopher Tolkien to meet the author’s exacting wishes, two large-format fold-out maps, a ribbon placemarker, gilded page edges, a color insert depicting Tolkien's own paintings of the Book of Mazarbul and exceptionally elegant and sturdy overall packaging housed within an attractive slipcase, this edition is the finest we’ve ever produced.","1184","2004-10-21","1955-10-20","0618517650","9780618517657","Hardcover","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497757613l/31._SX98_.jpg","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","66175","The Lord of the Rings","eng","[{name=to-read, count=231186}, {name=currently-reading, count=32505}, {name=fantasy, count=17122}, {name=favorites, count=10150}, {name=classics, count=5112}, {name=fiction, count=5092}, {name=owned, count=2046}, {name=books-i-own, count=1302}, {name=favourites, count=1035}, {name=classic, count=952}, {name=tolkien, count=826}, {name=adventure, count=740}, {name=sci-fi-fantasy, count=647}, {name=default, count=616}, {name=series, count=564}, {name=owned-books, count=468}, {name=epic-fantasy, count=458}, {name=high-fantasy, count=421}, {name=literature, count=419}, {name=novels, count=408}, {name=young-adult, count=401}, {name=fantasy-sci-fi, count=357}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=329}, {name=my-library, count=303}, {name=my-books, count=296}, {name=library, count=266}, {name=epic, count=264}, {name=re-read, count=261}, {name=1001-books, count=259}, {name=kindle, count=251}, {name=favorite-books, count=238}, {name=scifi-fantasy, count=237}, {name=magic, count=235}, {name=british, count=212}, {name=favorite, count=210}, {name=j-r-r-tolkien, count=204}, {name=sci-fi, count=203}, {name=novel, count=199}, {name=english, count=194}, {name=science-fiction-fantasy, count=191}, {name=fantasy-scifi, count=189}, {name=science-fiction, count=181}, {name=adult, count=161}, {name=to-buy, count=159}, {name=middle-earth, count=159}, {name=1001, count=154}, {name=i-own, count=154}, {name=books, count=153}, {name=fantasia, count=146}, {name=tbr, count=144}, {name=childhood, count=141}, {name=5-stars, count=137}, {name=abandoned, count=132}, {name=classic-literature, count=124}, {name=fantasy-fiction, count=124}, {name=home-library, count=124}, {name=sci-fi-and-fantasy, count=123}, {name=ebook, count=122}, {name=bookshelf, count=122}, {name=lord-of-the-rings, count=122}, {name=20th-century, count=120}, {name=shelfari-favorites, count=117}, {name=own-it, count=115}, {name=on-hold, count=113}, {name=to-re-read, count=111}, {name=childrens, count=110}, {name=fiction-fantasy, count=109}, {name=reread, count=108}, {name=dnf, count=107}, {name=unfinished, count=107}, {name=great-american-read, count=105}, {name=all-time-favourites, count=104}, {name=adult-fiction, count=104}, {name=faves, count=103}, {name=ebooks, count=100}, {name=1001-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=98}, {name=favourite, count=97}, {name=my-favorites, count=96}, {name=british-literature, count=95}, {name=did-not-finish, count=94}, {name=must-read, count=94}, {name=favourite-books, count=92}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=91}, {name=read-more-than-once, count=91}, {name=fantasía, count=90}, {name=finished, count=90}, {name=audiobook, count=87}, {name=to-reread, count=86}, {name=have, count=84}, {name=ya, count=84}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=80}, {name=audiobooks, count=79}, {name=100-books-to-read-before-you-die, count=78}, {name=speculative-fiction, count=78}, {name=jrr-tolkien, count=77}, {name=fantasy-science-fiction, count=76}, {name=modern-classics, count=75}, {name=mythology, count=75}, {name=personal-library, count=73}, {name=english-literature, count=73}]","1"

  <i>A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.</i>
</b><br /><br />Cath is a Simon Snow fan.<br /><br />Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..<br /><br />But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.<br /><br />Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.<br /><br />Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.<br /><br />For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?<br /><br />And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?","483","2013-09-10","2013-09-10",,,"Kindle Edition","https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355886270l/16068905._SX98_.jpg","St. Martin's Griffin",,,"eng","[{name=to-read, count=544255}, {name=favorites, count=14358}, {name=currently-reading, count=14270}, {name=young-adult, count=9557}, {name=contemporary, count=5978}, {name=romance, count=5532}, {name=ya, count=5478}, {name=books-i-own, count=3479}, {name=fiction, count=2994}, {name=owned, count=2454}, {name=favourites, count=1660}, {name=realistic-fiction, count=1059}, {name=new-adult, count=1008}, {name=read-in-2014, count=969}, {name=owned-books, count=875}, {name=audiobook, count=771}, {name=audiobooks, count=687}, {name=read-in-2015, count=685}, {name=chick-lit, count=658}, {name=coming-of-age, count=654}, {name=kindle, count=635}, {name=ya-contemporary, count=607}, {name=ebook, count=555}, {name=library, count=543}, {name=to-buy, count=542}, {name=dnf, count=527}, {name=ya-fiction, count=507}, {name=teen, count=500}, {name=read-in-2016, count=480}, {name=stand-alone, count=457}, {name=college, count=449}, {name=tbr, count=432}, {name=read-2014, count=423}, {name=my-books, count=415}, {name=read-in-2013, count=410}, {name=5-stars, count=410}, {name=audio, count=385}, {name=read-in-english, count=375}, {name=read-in-2017, count=369}, {name=mental-health, count=366}, {name=ebooks, count=347}, {name=i-own, count=333}, {name=all-time-favorites, count=333}, {name=favorite-books, count=325}, {name=re-read, count=311}, {name=2014-reads, count=310}, {name=contemporary-romance, count=308}, {name=on-my-shelf, count=300}, {name=contemporary-fiction, count=286}, {name=rainbow-rowell, count=284}, {name=faves, count=283}, {name=favorite, count=282}, {name=book-club, count=277}, {name=read-2015, count=271}, {name=english, count=270}, {name=4-stars, count=269}, {name=read-in-2018, count=268}, {name=family, count=263}, {name=bookshelf, count=260}, {name=funny, count=260}, {name=young-adult-fiction, count=257}, {name=standalone, count=249}, {name=realistic, count=242}, {name=reread, count=242}, {name=wish-list, count=239}, {name=my-bookshelf, count=237}, {name=read-in-2019, count=230}, {name=ya-romance, count=227}, {name=my-library, count=220}, {name=ya-lit, count=218}, {name=humor, count=218}, {name=reviewed, count=217}, {name=love, count=210}, {name=ya-books, count=207}, {name=did-not-finish, count=206}, {name=audio-books, count=203}, {name=2015-reads, count=200}, {name=friendship, count=199}, {name=mental-illness, count=196}, {name=novels, count=195}, {name=read-2016, count=191}, {name=books, count=191}, {name=stand-alones, count=191}, {name=e-book, count=187}, {name=favs, count=187}, {name=on-my-bookshelf, count=186}, {name=books-about-books, count=184}, {name=read-2017, count=176}, {name=favoritos, count=175}, {name=cute, count=166}, {name=lgbtq, count=161}, {name=e-books, count=153}, {name=want-to-buy, count=152}, {name=books-i-have, count=151}, {name=read-in-2020, count=150}, {name=standalones, count=150}, {name=book-boyfriends, count=148}, {name=teen-fiction, count=146}, {name=library-books, count=144}, {name=own-it, count=141}]","1"
